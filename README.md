# Journal Analysis & NLP

* Came up with this incredibly nerdy idea whilst doing my nightly journaling but I'm actually super eager to do it - but the idea is essentially to create a little Streamlit app that somehow pulls my journal entries and does text analysis - e.g. produces word clouds to show word frequencies (I assume profanity will be high up on there, and also uhhh Andrew), data abt the lengths of my entries and how that varies with day of the week, perhaps some sentiment analysis, etc. 
* So the main challenge of this is actually pulling the journal entries, bc I don't think Apple Journal provides users with any way of doing that programmatically?? So I might have to manually transfer my entries to somewhere accessible, but obviously that's not ideal innit. And I'd want the app to update on its own every day at say 5am (and also have the option to update manually) and add all the new entries to the dataset.
* It looks like I can export my entries from a certain date range as a PDF, so that may be te only way that my application can actually access my entries.
