53,2024-01-13,This app just magically appeared on my Home Screen. Great idea of an app btw
52,2024-01-14,"It’s Monday technically rn but I haven’t slept yet so I consider it Sunday. Anyways. It’s my last night home  of winter break and for whatever reason I’m so incredibly anxious abt going back to school. I think it’s  mainly bc last semester was a disaster by my standards. Not a single thing went my way to be quite honest.  And I want this semester to make up for it. I’ll also miss family so much. I never appreciate my time with  them enough and it maddens me that I do that. I’ll so miss Jiant and mommy especially, and I wanna make  sure I really do call them weekly this semester and on. College is great bc of the independence that I have -  the ability for me to simply do whatever I want and go wherever I want whenever I want. It’s great. But it’s  also so isolating when you’re someone like me, who doesn’t go out of their way to socialize and make  friends. It’s horrible to feel alone and uncared about, whereas care and love is guaranteed at home (which I  feel so lucky to say). I could not be luckier to have Hannah as my roommate. Almost anyone else and my  entire college experience would be so different. So different. Anyways. I’m genuinely incredibly stressed.  Dreading everything. It’s gonna be so cold this first week back. And I’m getting there tmr at like 4.30 and  I’ll probs just unpack and stuff and I’ll have to find all my classrooms Tuesday morning. Not ideal,  considering my original plan was to get to campus on Sunday and find my classes on Monday. But oh well.  Wisdom teeth changed that. On a positive note, they feel a lot better. Still painful obviously and ofc I’m still  unable to eat solid foods, but it’s okay. We’re getting there. My face swelling has gone down a lot. Almost  completely good. I don’t feel like I’m in the right mentality for school and this sucks a lot. My brain feels  empty. I feel stupid and antisocial and everyone seems to annoy me. It’s a tough time. My period is coming  though so ig I could be overly emotional for this reason. But genuinely, I’m freaked kinda. I really hope this  semester treats me well. At least I get to come home in two weeks. The bus is so annoying tbh but oh well.  Dreading tmr a lot. But time goes on. At least there’s some playoff football I can catch to distract myself. I  plan to set my New Year ’s resolutions tmr. Which ik they’re late but I felt like if I wasn’t in the mindset to  do them earlier. I should probs write them down. I’ll j do them now actually."
51,2024-03-09,"Hi      so I haven’t journaled in ages. I feel like I should actually set the habit of journaling each night before  I sleep. I used to do that and found it helpful. Anyways. I’ve had a lot on my mind recently. Relating to…  well, romantic interests. Not that I really have any. But I would like to. I feel like I am ready. I think. And I  never told you this, but a couple weeks ago on a Monday I got asked out by two random guys who just saw  me and decided to make their move. Which was so crazy bc that never happens. Like it is so so so so rare  that even one happens. Two in one day? Insane. It’s like that thing where people ask how many owls you  have to see in a day to feel like something is up. 3 in a day and for sure I’d think something was up. But ig I  was just in the right place at the right time two times that day. Or maybe the wrong place, bc I did in fact go  out w them both that week and wasn’t fond of them. There was a Korean guy named Noah who slipped me  a note in the WCP w his number, and I got his insta and thought he was way cute, but he turned out to be  kind of an ass. Which I genuinely did not expect. Other guy stopped me while I was rushing to the EER  but we chatted for like 3 minutes, I left my number and all. He was honestly chill but a little creepy. Like he  stared a lot. And talked kinda monotone? Idk. Which so do I but it’s weird when others do it ok. And he was  so touchy. I went to his place after we got a coffee (terrible idea on a first date w a guy I don’t know, I  realized that almost immediately but was like whatever). We cuddled bc I will never turn that down. He  smelled good. His place was SO nice, like genuinely the nicest place I’ve seen. Like a ski cabin almost. But  yeah. He massaged me which was kinda weird but it felt nice. He uhh kinda sucked my neck a little (which  I was kinda too shocked to move at the time but oh well) and then tried to kiss me like 5 times. It was funny  bc I didn’t expect it and I turned and his face was right there                 but I turned my face the other direction the  first few times and he kinda laughed and was like aw you’re so shy and then we kinda laid sideways and he  tried again for a kiss and I just let him. Bc yk, I don’t like knowing that I’ve never kissed a guy. And even if  this one was just like a fling sorta thing I just thought I ought to experience it. So yeah. Hannah called me at  like 5.30 to bail me out of there and I met her and Kenadi at the WCP. But tbh that day it was so shocking  and traumatizing to me. So I ended up doing nothing for the whole rest of the day even though I acc had  tons of work to do. I was miserable that day like genuinely. But now I’m looking back like ok it was fine, I  was really overreacting it was truly whatever. Anyways. All that to say that I feel like I am ready for a  relationship. I would like to experience romantic love. It seems so healing to meet the right person. And  lately I’ve been thinking back on Jazhiel a lot. Like a lot. It never sat right with me how we ended things.  Which idk if we really did officially. We just stopped talking. But I think at the time I just wasn’t prepared  and wasn’t ready. He was so sweet. And having met the other two guys recently, and realizing how they  didn’t actually care for me in the way he did…that’s eye opening. Not every day you can meet a guy who  genuinely loves you for who you are. He was the sweetest guy and he really did like me. I liked him too,  and I’m not so sure why I wasn’t attracted to him. Not to say I am now, bc to be quite honest I don’t  remember what he looks like and what he is like personality wise. But I just feel like I didn’t appreciate him  enough. Which I did let him know way early on that I hadn’t been interested in him when he first mentioned  his interest. So it shouldn’t have been a surprise. Just like…I still feel bad. And I’ve thought so many times  abt messaging him. I acc realized I didn’t follow him on insta so I did that today, then retracted it like an  hour later bc it felt weird. Idk how to feel abt it. And it makes me sad that everyone else is in a relationship  or at least knows what it’s like to be in one…I don’t. I don’t think I’m jealous, it’s more of a longing or  admiration. Anyways. Yeah. That’s where I’m at rn."
50,2024-03-11,"So I’m going insane, actually. Forgot to take my lexapro for a couple days so that might be the root of the  issue. But I keep seeing reels that are like let people know how you feel, communicate effectively timely,  blah blah blah. And now I feel miserable for not communicating well w Jazhiel at the time. Which I did  follow him on insta and he followed back and liked both my posts. But like it had me thinking, I almost  want to reach out and be like hey I’m sorry I didn’t communicate well with you then, thank you for being  mature and understanding and patient with me. And idk, if he asked me now, would I say yes to being with  him? Honestly I probably would. Based on my experiences with two other guys who didn’t care that much  for me and for who I was as a person. He truly did and I appreciate that so much now. But I don’t want to  reach out, bc first I don’t want to look like I’m running back to him after I didn’t appreciate him enough.  Even though that kinda is what it is. And second idk if I would even like him like that. I just really want him  to know that he is a great guy and treated me so well and I regret that I didn’t seem grateful enough, or  reciprocate enough. And like sure, maybe I would like him this time. But obviously it’s an uncertainty and  I’m not gonna capitalize on the chance if I’m more than uncertain about it. But yeah. More than anything  I’m just so grateful that he treated me so well, and I’m sad I didn’t let him know how thankful I was. He  was a great guy. And sure, maybe next time if I ever see him around campus things would change. But for  now I really dk. Maybe I will text him. Idk. Thing is, I feel like I am simply craving someone that loves me.  Romantically. And I’d just take anyone. And I don’t want that to be the case bc it would be bad for both of  us. And it would be so inconsiderate for me to be like I’ll get with you for my ego, even if I don’t feel the  same? Or ig really what I want is to feel loved and to also feel that same love for the opposite party. Yeah. I  want to feel attracted to someone. Which I’ve never been one to feel romantic love towards anyone, so that  would be new. But just saying. If he asked me now, would o accept? I think I might."
49,2024-03-12,"Listening to what was I made for on loop and having a quiet cry session. Sometimes I really hate breaks  from school bc this almost always happens…me in my room listening to the saddest music and having a cry  bc I feel so lonely and isolated. Because when I’m home it reminds me that genuinely nobody cares about  me outside my own family. Nobody texts me, it’s just me alone with my thoughts for a whole week and a  couple days. It’s horrible. Loneliness is such a horrible feeling because it really takes over your whole mind  and body. It’s so depressing. When times like these happen I remember the times in like 2020 and 2021  when I was actively horribly depressed, and I was cooped up in my room doing the worst things to myself. I  hate being lonely and unloved like this. It almost being my 20th birthday makes it worse, because it’s like  wow, my teenage years are gone and I don’t know if I lived them as they should’ve been lived. The only  time I felt truly at peace with my being was honestly recent times at college when I truly felt appreciated by  Hannah and her friends who I can now call my friends. Being at home is different though because truly it  feels as though I am uncared about and unloved. And I’m really so close to being 20. I hate that everyone I  know talks about their high school years so fondly. But I’m here knowing that those years and junior high  school were the worst of my life. I had no friends and didn’t fit in anywhere. No matter my efforts. I’d go to  school and not say a single word to anyone and come home and lie on the ground watching YouTube. And  it’s depressing to think that might have happened again in college if not for Hannah. Who I love so so  deeply and I would truly do anything for her. I’d like to think that I’ve grown a lot as a person since college.  I’ve grown a lot socially. But I’m still definitely not a popular person at all and hence the loneliness rn.     I think the feeling unloved is the worst feeling to ever experience. It’s so horrible because it’s like. Nobody  cares about me. Nobody gives a flying fuck about me. If I killed myself right here right now, would  anybody care? I’m not anyone’s first choice, even if I call so many people my first choice. I don’t know  how to make myself more…loved, I guess. Why don’t people like me? Why am I so unlikable, so  unapproachable? All I do is try my best, truly. I hate being in the forgotten realm. And I get so upset around  my birthday because all the friends that I have everything for to make have long forgotten my birthday, even  if I wish them happy birthday each year at 12 on the dot. It’s so sad to think that I am so forgettable. That  nothing we did together ever mattered. And I think that as I’ve grown I’ve come to terms with the fact that  people move on. Even if I’m slow to. But it’ll never not hurt, you know? Especially considering that this  point - the point of my former best friends no longer caring for me - was the tipping point for me in so many  years prior. Really I don’t even know what I’m so upset about now. I guess it’s just that I feel so lonely right  now. I think maybe that’s why this week I’ve been craving a romantic relationship. Or at least, the idea of it  seems so nice rn because I could really use a person who reassures me every day that I am loved. Someone I  can attach myself to. Someone I can love. You know? But no. I don’t ever get that. I hate these nights  because I feel so disconnected from the world. I am alone in my own little universe where I matter to  nobody. And these nights will always make me think back to the worst years of my life because they are the  root of why those were the worst years of my life. Never finding my place wherever I was. Nobody  acknowledging me. And mommy being too busy for me. Jiant being all the way across the globe. School  every day was hell, because I was so so alone. Band sucked, because Ms. Holdford picked on me and  everyone else hated me. Zach…fuck you. And them all changing up on me after I became first chair?  Genuinely go fuck yourselves. And at lunchtime I’d sit wedged in between these people I didn’t know andnever talked to because I didn’t feel comfortable doing so. It was awful. And I remember the gradual development of my eating disorder. I stopped getting actual lunch and just brought ziplock bags of raisins and a few nuts scattered in between. Then I’d go to English class and I remember there being a party once or something and Ms Martin had brought cookies and it was such a dilemma for me of whether I could eat them. To this day I don’t know how I didn’t realize that I had an eating disorder. It just happened and the doctors told me that and I was like ohhh. Whole time I was away from school nobody gave a fuck. Only thing I remember was Mr Oredson being really nice in his emails. Mrs Redding too. It’s just so sad to think that that’s what I turned to at my lowest point. The only way I could feel satisfaction was by controlling myself and feeling good about it after I had a “good day.” A good day meaning I stuck to however many calories I allowed myself to consume. Which was nothing btw. I allotted like 900 calories a day I think. Or 800. Either way. To think that that’s what I turned to depresses me all the time. I’m comfortable with joking about it now but when I think more deeply about it it pains me to my soul. To my core. To think that I never had an actual friend in Texas until Yuanxi and Authencia is honestly such a joke. I never hung out with anyone outside school until them. That’s insane. And I hear about Hannah’s high school experiences and I realize that’s how it should be, and I never got to experience all that. I was alone the whole time. And it’s nice to know that I made it this far without moral and social support. But it’s still just sad. And I don’t like sitting around moping about what could’ve been but I think  sometimes it helps. Somehow. I’m not even a huge cryer. And today is the most I’ve cried in probably years. It’s just. I don’t know if I’ll ever achieve a state in life where I feel truly and deeply loved. I am definitely the closest to that now, with Hannah. I love her so much and I know she loves me too. I don’t know why I’m so upset rn tbh. But it’s still like…she’s the only person I have that bond with. And I’m so scared of losing her. Because if I ever do, who will I have left? Who will fill the void once we graduate? Will I ever find someone like her? And being 20 so soon makes me feel like I can’t rely on my parents as much anymore. I’ll truly be on my own, and I’m so scared that I’ll be stuck in a never ending loop of loneliness. Which I guess is fine, because that’s how it’s always been. For as long as I can remember in Texas. I don’t want that to be my reality, but I don’t know how to make it…not be. I met Hannah out of luck, like truly. It’s so hard for me to form these bonds on my own. I just really hate this feeling. I can bawl my eyes out right now - which I’m as close to that as I have been in ages - and nobody will give a shit. I’m just alone. Just me and my thoughts and my silly old journal with a persona that I made up when I was like 8 because I had nobody to talk to. I hate being back home for such extended periods now because this happens all the damn time. I have nothing to do all break because I don’t have any friends here. Hannah talks about her and her friends going to a tulip farm which is so cute but I’m here rotting away in my room. Sleeping past 1 every day because I mean what else am I gonna do? I have nobody to talk to. nobody to go out with. it's honestly just plain misery. id love to do something with my family but theyre all busy doing whatever theyre doing. i'm just here. I wish it were different. I will always think back to the times in Shanghai when I had genuine friends who my family loved and we’d hang out in school and outside school and everything, and then we moved and I lost them all. Everything was just gone in the blink of an eye. My cats. My babies who were literally the light of my life…I doubt they’re even alive now. I lost everything. From the best times of my life to the immediate worst. I’d give so much for myself to not have had to experience those beginning years in Katy. It has scarred me forever. To this day I think things would’ve been different if we’d just brought Goldie and snowy here. I never even had a proper goodbye with them. Sure, I have dumbo, but it’ll always be different. It’ll never be the same ever again. I lost my babies that we raised from literally the very beginning. I will never stop missing them. And I just don’t understand why we couldn’t bring them here. And my biggest regret ever is not trying harder to bring them here with us. Because everything would be different. But now they’re probably dead. And it’s so hardfor me to accept. Because they’re my babies. I just hope that if there’s a heaven and if I go there, that I can be reunited with them. I’d give anything to be with them still. I miss them more than words could express. I’ve just ugly cried and my nose is completely stuffed and I can’t breathe out it at all. I’m just so sad man. Just…how could I go from having everything to having nothing in such little time? Truly. Everything I had…just gone. To think that I went through that is so painful. As a nearly 20 year old adult now, looking back at 12 year old me and knowing what she went through really sucks. I guess I feel stronger having experienced all that, but obviously I wish it were never the case. But the root of all those issues I don’t know if it’ll ever go away. And the fact that the eating disorder is something I’ll never fully recover from is just so sad. I still have trouble feeling hunger signals. And I still dabble all the oil off pizza or burgers or any oily foods. It won’t change. All that because I was an outsider and outcast at school and came home to an empty house after school with nothing to comfort me. Because I felt truly so alone. Like I am right now, in my bed in the dark sobbing listening to a song that breaks me on repeat. Inside I am just the same little junior high girl who realized she was painfully alone. Pondering her existence and what she was doing wrong, or what was wrong with her. The same girl at Seven Lakes who could only find satisfaction in laying in bed at the end of the day stroking her flat stomach and praising herself for eating fuck all that day. The same girl at BISH who’d take a box cutter to the wrist at midnight crying so she could feel something. It’s sad to know that the little girl in me is still there and might not ever heal. But I guess that’s how it is. It’s fine. It’s whatever. I’m done now."
48,2024-03-17,"I can’t tell if today was a great day or a depressing one…we celebrated my birthday early with the whole  family since I’m leaving tmr. And turning 20…it’s no joke. turning 17 and 18 and 19 is kinda just whatever.  they all feel pretty similar. maybe 18 is a little different since it’s when I became an actual adult but you  understand. 20 is so different and it’s honestly so unpleasant to realize how old I am. and how fast time has  passed. and how I’m a full fledged adult now but I still don’t feel like I lived out my teenage years. I cried  over it earlier today and I think I’m going to again in a bit - but it’s so strange and so scary to think about. I  feel like as a 20 year old you can’t really make any little oopsies anymore.                      you have to do everything right  and you have to know what you’re doing. which obviously isn’t true but you get what I’m going at right?  and I’m freaking out about it to be quite honest. my whole life I’ve seen my parents as, well, my parents. as  mature, fully responsible adults who know everything they know and hold well paying jobs and take care of  us kids. and that always seemed so far away. so distant, like I’d never really get there. but now I’m basically  there and I am so freaked out. I’m crying again now. but I’m so scared. I don’t even truly know why. but  this is terrifying to me. and I don’t quite know why I am upset. I think I can narrow it down to 2 things.  firstly it’s just that there is so much more responsibility that comes with this milestone age. I’m not my  parents’ little girl anymore and will never be. I’m an adult now and I can’t just rely on my parents like I’ve  always known. and it just hit me like a ton of bricks today and it is genuinely so upsetting. secondly. I’ve  said this before but I don’t think I lived my teenage years to its full potential. not even close, if I had to be  honest. it seems silly to complain about my life as if I don’t have so much more than my parents and my  grandparents or any older member of my family ever had. but when I talk to everyone I know at school, I  can’t believe how much I missed out on. not having a single good friend in Texas (the state) until Hannah is  kind of baffling to think about. ig I had yuanxi but we really weren’t best friends at all. We barely shared  any interests and the only thing that brought us together was the fact that we spoke Chinese. but yeah. it’s  like…I feel like I’m not ready to move on from being in my teen years. idk if 18 and up is considered a teen  but bear with me and this vocabulary convention. I just didn’t live it up to its full potential. I don’t feel like  I’ve experienced enough. and now the teenager title is gone and I’m an oldie now and it’s terrible.  anyways.     it was so nice to see my family today. And to spend this big day with them. I’m so grateful that they are all  here. I love them. So much. and the gifts I got today were all so considerate. I cried. lol. this is my third time  crying today (technically yesterday but it’s still today until I shower and brush my teeth and stuff). just  made a cry chronicles in my notes app to record all my crying bc it his is the 4th time this week. anyways.  mommy and jiant got me a massive photo album with pictures from my baby years all up to now. which got  me good bc it was the sweetest thing ever and I know mommy spent so much time on it…I’m kinda sobbing  now but it was just so sweet…like she’d written the month and year on every photo so she could put them in  the album chronologically and I know selecting all those photos must’ve taken forever. I went through the  album like 5 times today with different people. seeing myself as a baby and then myself now…it hits so  hard, you know? why does the time have to pass so quickly?? and I know my parents definitely miss when  Justin and I were babies. as you get older it’s never the same. and I look back at all the good times and I  think about how much my parents have given me. they’ve brought me traveling to so many cool places and  have done so much for me, truly. man. I could not ask for better parents, genuinely. they do so much. somuch. and as I get older I’m only going to get less and less dependent on them, which ofc is less work for them but I’m going to miss being their little girl…and they’re gonna be empty nesters soon which is so weird!! ok I gotta stop rambling bc I’m gonna cry more. but then Nainai got me a heart shaped necklace that I’m wearing rn. it’s so pretty. so shiny. And she’d asked me a couple days ago to choose a design so ofc I knew it was coming. but she is so sweet. and the necklace is so pretty. she also cooked one of her amazing dishes today and it was so good. we made 包⼦                 together the other day too which was so much fun even though I sucked. yeye got me a necklace too. It is probably the most unique necklace I’ll ever get. it’s a necklace whose pendant is made of jade (but you can’t see the jade unless you turn it around) and the front is adorned with gold. and in the middle there’s like a little circle and inside there is a lil monkey holding a peach. and it spins! and you can hear the little whirring every time you move and it spins with your movement. so I got two necklaces. idk how I’m going to delegate wearing them ngl. they both look good. I was thinking I’ll change it each week but I’ll def forget. either way I’ll be bringing both to Austin. I think I’ll hang it up on my board next to my bed so I can see it. Waipo and waigong gave me money as always - which is sweet bc they never know what to get me so they ask me to use the (hefty sum of) money to get whatever I like. Jiant got me a book written by a cofounder of DeepMind I think it was. I’ve been out of my reading era for ages but I so want to get back into it so I think I will. brain food as always from jiant and I really appreciate that. mommy also got me these gorgeous earrings. they’re dangly and kinda 3d diamond but round is how I’d describe it. they look so fancy which is why I think they’re gonna be my going out or fancy event earrings. sooo pretty. ok I’ve kinda recovered now and my hand is going numb so I’m gonna shower and sleep…if I don’t feel like coming back and crying again. so long."
47,2024-03-18,It’s my birthday                  and idk how to feel. So here I am to write about it and hopefully I won’t cry. I  think it doesn’t feel awful right now because I already cried over it yesterday. Bawled actually. It’s nice that  I have myself a couple days to let it sink in. It still doesn’t feel great ofc. It’s funny how we (people  collectively) look forward to our birthdays as a kid and as time goes on we dread it. I think it just sucks right  now because it’s a milestone age. Probably the worst I’ll ever feel on a birthday. Because 20 is truly the  milestone if there ever was one. You’re well and truly an adult. No excuses. Less lenience. Impending  independence from parents. It’s all so sudden. Not that I’m not already an adult with considerable  independence. It’s just that it’s all skyrocketing now. Turning 30 will probably suck too. But not as much I  think. Idk anymore. I just dk how to feel abt it all. I don’t feel 20. It’s like when it’s January of a new year  and you keep writing the previous year when you write the date. It’s like that but worse. If you understand.  Bc I genuinely don’t feel 20. What is 20 even supposed to feel like?? Idk but I don’t feel like it. Birthdays  suck man. Reminds me every time of my mortality. And everyone’s mortality. I hate it. As in aging is  inevitable. For everyone. And I can’t physically see me get older and look older but like…it’s happening.  Every second. Every minute. Gahhhh. Hate it here bro. I will be back momentarily…perhaps.
46,2024-04-03,"Hi! So!!! Big update. Well not that big tbf. But I went to west fest like 2 weekends ago and had sm fun but.  There was this guy I saw at the first party we went to, DU. I saw him and was thinking he was pretty and  thought abt going up to him but ended not doing so. I couldn’t tell if he’d seen me but lowkey I was kinda  staring so I thought he’d probs noticed. But I was kinda sad when we left DU bc the vibes were so good and  also I figured I wasn’t ever gonna see him again. Then we went to KA (I think). The band - Mango coast -  was SO good!! I discovered afterwards that their bassist was in my FRI haha. But we had lots of fun there  too. And as we were leaving, there was that guy! I saw him and probably stared again. Then we left. I  wasn’t gonna go up to him then bc I was tired and we were leaving anyways. Then the next day. Saturday. I  went to a darty alone - ZBT - since Hannah and Sydney were doing homework. But yeah I went and drank a  little, and towards the end there he was again! At that point I was like wtf. I would’ve gone up to him if he  wasn’t already w another girl. I even waited a little. Then ended up leaving bc I knew my face was red af  plus I had to meet Hannah and everyone else at Cabo bob’s. At that point I was like damn I’m genuinely not  gonna see him again. THEN. We went to Pike that night to try and see NLE choppa. The line was insane  and we ended up not getting in, but we stayed outside the gates for a bit to watch everything go down and  also just to hear the show from outside. Like an hour in - guess who was there lmao!! He walked past me  and I probably did a double take. I was like ain’t no wayyyy. He stopped in his tracks and turned back and  came up to me saying he’d seen me at the last 3 events he’d gone to (exactly three yeah). I was like yeah I  saw you too!! And I told him roughly what was going on at Pike and he said he and his friend Ricardo were  gonna try and jump the gates. I asked for his insta bc no way I wasn’t. Later we went to BYX and he was  there too and if we hadn’t left early I would’ve tried to talk. But oh well. And at that point I knew I wasn’t  gonna see bro again but I had his insta! And I stalked it and uhhh fell in love kinda. Bc he makes music…  plays the guitar beautifully…and his music is acc good and reminds me of Dominic fike!! And he is also  beautiful and has a beautiful voice like aghhhhhh. A couple days later I was like ok I gotta reach out or I’m  never getting over him so I DMed saying I’d checked out his music and he reminded me so much of  dominic fike. He responded not long after saying it was a huge compliment bc he was his muse. And we  kept talking up until yesterday (so it was like close to a week ig). He was acc keeping the convo going - like  I genuinely thought it’d be like a quick 2-message exchange but no thank god. Over the weekend on the bus  back he asked me if I’d lived in Shanghai and I was really surprised but I said yeah for six years and he said  he did too! Out years in SH overlap by a little. He also knows Chinese like wtf. I’m in love w him. Fully.  I’ve NEVER been in love w anyone so I need you to know how serious this is. Genuinely I thought I was  incapable of love bc I’d never had the crushes that people always talk abt having. But no. I get it now. Bro is  always on my mind. I listen to his music. I stalk his insta every once in a while. And like wow I think abt  him a lot. We last spoke yesterday at like 7 - he sent a picture of himself so I sent one back and I haven’t  heard back since. Which lowkey stressed me out all day today bc I don’t want to stop talking. I really like  him and talking to him bc he kinda reminds me of me by the way he talks. Idk. Somehow. And I’m stressed  bc like I thought it was going so well                       was you still gotta send me your Dominic fike covers                              but  yeah I’m stressed. Ofc he could just be busy. OH and he’s also a biochem major!! So he’s smart too!! Like  that is so cool. Oh I also forgot to mention he doesn’t go here lmao. He’s at UCSD. so that’s kinda  complicated. But yeah. I’m just kinda sad. I’ve been a little down all day today bc of that partially and also  bc I have no genuine work to do. But I do have work tmr so hopefully it’ll be better. But I’ve been playing  the saxophone a ton to fill my time. And it has been soooo fun. I managed to transcribe frisky bc I thoughtit’d sound so good on the sax esp when I figure out how to growl. But that song has SIX sharps which is kinda annoying. Either way. I played up to what I transcribed and recorded it and it was so fun today. I was literally singing and skipping on the way home I was so happy ahahah. Like it cheered me up so much. It was so fun. Then I went to the gym alone for leg day and it acc sucked like everything was crazy hard somehow, even the calf extensions which are my favorite… but ig I did go up on Bulgarians and RDLs and also skipped dinner which probs wasn’t ideal. But when I finished I fully felt like throwing up it was terrible. I love leg day so it sucked to feel disgusting like that. Anyways. That’s all I have. Just wanted to update you on the uhhh recent developments in my life. Fell in love w some beautiful guy who ik it’s not gonna work out with, and have been saxophoning a TON (like 9.5 hours since last Thursday). So yep. That’s all I’ve got. Gonna sleep soon so gn."
45,2024-04-07,"(1.20am)   Right, so. Lowkey having a bit of a tough time rn. First off I think I’m sick - I woke up this morning (really  at noon) with a stabbing sore throat…I tend to have a sore throat pretty often but this was one of those ones  where you know it’s more than just allergies and it’s acc gonna last the whole day. It hurt so bad. Hannah  has been sick for the last week so maybe it was from her, which btw ofc I’d never blame her. But it hurt like  a bitch and also I was just so tired and cranky. Like I felt sick. So I climbed out of bed at like 3 to get ready  and then eat a lil and then do laundry. After that around 5ish I went to go play sax bc I didn’t wanna stay in  the dorm all day. The walk to the MRH sucked more than usual and I was so winded. I played for about an  hour and 45 mins which was longer than I expected to play. But damn I was having a tough time there.  Second. He hasn’t texted me back since yesterday (Friday) night and it makes me sad. Like I hate to be  inconveniencing him but also I’m head over heels in love w him. I also have a great pickup like I need to  use on him and only him. It’s just sad yk, to be obsessed w someone who obviously does not feel even  remotely the same. It just be like that. But I miss him. And I don’t want our convo to just end where it did. I  hope he replies, I really do. But ok yeah. I’m tired af so I’m gonna sleep. Nighty."
44,2024-04-12,"Right so. Uhhh some interesting updates. The guy from west fest - Jude - we’ve talked a lot over  the past several weeks but he takes a long time to respond sometimes so I ended the convo  yesterday so I can stop bothering him. He’s such a sweetie but I just don’t want to seem all  attached and stuff. I am, but I can’t seem like it lol. He now follows my spam also so it’s not like we  won’t be staying somewhat in contact and stuff. It’s all good w me. Half the reason why I felt okay  with ending this 3 week convo we had was bc I met this guy at the gym who asked for my number  on Wednesday evening. So Hannah has been sick for a while (I am now too but she had it way  worse) so I’ve been going to the gym alone this week. I skipped Monday though bc I’m not lifting  alone. But yeah, I did back and bi on Wednesday. I was on the bicep curl machine and I’d just  ﬁnished my second set and this guy came over. He was super smiley which was honestly mad  cute, and he asked if he could work in w me. I was like yeah of course, I’ve only got one set left  anyways. I let him go ahead and do his set while I rested a bit. When I headed back I noticed he’d  put the machine back into the 20s that I had been doing…                           which idk I don’t think he was  doing the 20s but I also couldn’t really tell. Hadn’t paid attention like that. So I ﬁnished my last set  and was gonna tell him it was all his now but then he was like oh I’m actually not even doing arms  today I just saw you and I wanted to ﬁnd some way to talk to you…I have zero recollection of what  I said to that which is weird bc usually I’d remember it all. I think I was kinda like awww though. Idk  how we even moved the conversation on from then but we exchanged names and majors, I listed  my classes, and he asked for my number which I gave him. I lowkey thought he was really cute  but he was wearing a hoodie and a baseball hat so to be so fair I couldn’t even see most of what  he looked like bc my memory of faces is like nonexistent. I don’t remember what bro looks like. It’s  awful and this happens every damn time. But I will say that he was mad charming. Like that shit  worked so well on me that I haven’t stopped thinking abt it since it happened. I ﬁnished up my  workout though and he messaged me while batyr and Authencia and I were hanging out. We’ve  decided to study together on Monday sometime. Hopefully in the afternoon. But yeah. He’s cute af  texting too.     Right so it’s 2pm now. I posted a couple times on my story to you know, update the fans on my  life. Jk. But Jude liked my story. Not sure what to take from that but also I’ve liked his stories  before so it’s chill. Anyways let me continue abt the other guy. His name is Andrew. I still cannot  for my life remember what he looks like. Or what color his hair even is. I think he was brunette but  I lowkey don’t know. He was also wearing a hat I’m pretty sure. Uhhhh no glasses. Idk but my ﬁrst  impression literally when he asked to work in was that I thought he was cute. So we’re gonna  study together on Monday. I was saying how he texts cute. Him and Jude both text in a way that  reminds me of myself. Jude language-wise?? Idk it’s hard to explain but he reminds me of me  except he’s cooler. Andrew texts really cute. Exclamation marks and such. And he seems like a  sweetie like genuinely. He told me how it was the ﬁrst time he’d asked for a number so he  apologized if it was awkward and I was like                         noooo babygirl you did so well!! And I  genuinely meant it like I was thinking surely that wasn’t his ﬁrst time. But yeah. Gonna see how it  goes Monday. I’m trying to keep my expectations real low bc yk how the others have gone. Noahwas a fuckin asshole and Connor was weird. So yep I’m really trying not to expect much. We’re just gonna go with the ﬂow yk. What an interesting several weeks haha.    I feel like I really want a relationship at this point in my life. It would be so nice. But I also would hate to get in a relationship not knowing if I was getting into it just bc I wanted to not be alone, or if I truly loved the person. And that’s why I feel so bad for messaging Jazhiel over break. Like why did I do that. He still texts from time to time which confuses me but it’s whatever. We’re chill. What I’m saying is that I feel ready to be in a relationship. And it would be so so nice. I just can’t get my expectations up. I’m a lil scared but excited too. And I acc gotta stop thinking abt this so much lmao. But he rizzed me good let’s just say. Hahaha"
43,2024-04-15,"Right. So not much to update but I just wanted to journal. Tomorrow (technically today) I’ll be  properly meeting Andrew, the guy that asked for my number at the gym. We’ve arranged to meet  at 6pm to study together at the PCL. He already seems like such a sweetie. And I’m so glad we’re  not doing anything overly serious. Like all the other “dates” I went on were at coffee / boba shops.  Not that they knew I dislike coffee and boba. But it just seemed so serious it was intimidating.  Even if I was the one being asked out, not the one who needed to, yk, impress them. Studying  together at probably the most public space on campus is a nice change. I appreciate it. He also  offered to get food afterwards which was sweet. I’m annoyed though bc genuinely I don’t  remember what he looks like. And I have zero knowledge of how tall he is, what color his eyes  are, or anything physical. All I know is that my ﬁrst impression was that he was cute, which is a  massive positive. All the other guys I talked to, with all due respect, did not make me think oh he’s  cute. He also asked if I was feeling better since I told him I’ve been sick - that was so sweet too.  Like awh. I’m kinda excited to get to know him. But at the same time I’m genuinely so scared it  won’t work out? Bc I always feel bad when it doesn’t. To be fair, Noah and Connor I don’t even  know if they were looking for much. Connor was deﬁnitely wanting like a ﬂing. Noah probablythought I was boring bc I didn’t reciprocate. Jazhiel yes, he was looking for something serious but in total honesty, while he was so kind and so sweet, I just wasn’t attracted to him. Which I’ve felt bad about for literally forever. I think I’m ready for a proper relationship, but I’m just scared it doesn’t work out bc that’ll stress me out. Idk. I shouldn’t preemptively expect bad things. Which honestly I get good vibes so I think it might actually go well, but at the same time I’m deﬁnitely keeping my expectations low. Anyways. Oh uhh and about Jude. We’ve been talking throughout the day kinda but really just as buddies. And I like the vibes between us. Casual but also I think we enjoy each other ’s company at least a little. Like a week ago I’d be freaking out over him replying to my stories. But really now I’m just like ooh cool. If he asked I still would though. In a heartbeat. Just saying. I’m glad I’ve gotten over him for the most part. Bc the last couple weeks were tragic. I was panicking over him not responding. But I mean, if he wanted to he would. Gotta take hints. I still think he’s gorgeous and just so cool. But I know when to stop myself. Let me tell you a bit abt my weekend too before I ﬁnish up. I slept sooooo much this weekend it was genuinely awful. I probably slept for like 70% of the weekend or something. But also, in the time that I wasn’t sleeping I’d say I had fun. On Saturday I decided to go ﬁnd Austin’s Asian town. I got on the wrong bus on the way there (I didn’t realize the 801 and the 803 routes deviated before I had to get off) so I ended up walking in the scorching heat for like half an hour to the next bus stop to redirect myself. But we made it there ultimately. I went into 99 ranch market and got some snacks and a peach drink and some chocolate almond cookies. I ate some whilst waiting for the bus back. I also went through the Kinokuniya and Daiso stores next door. Didn’t get anything but wanted to look around. And then today (Sunday) I just wanted to explore the actual city instead of being in the suburbs. So I bussed to the public library stop, went to Trader Joe’s and got onion rings and cheese puffs (ﬁnished the onion rings so quickly), and then I just strolled around. I crossed the bridge over ladybird lake (my favorite view!!) which put me at auditorium shores, which is this big grassy plain with a perfect view of the skyline. So I sat there and munched on my onion rings for a bit. Enjoyed it. It was hot. But I cooled down after sitting for a bit. So then I left to head back - walked back across the bridge, took some beautiful pictures, and then back to the stop near the library. and yeah. When I got back I took another nap which like I said I’ve been sleeping wayyyy too much. But yeah that’s about all. I will be back to update again soon. Hopefully tomorrow. Goodnight !!"
42,2024-04-16,"Right so the update. Bit late but here goes. I love himmmmmm. He’s so sweet I’m kinda obsessed  w him actually. And I remember what he looks like now ahahah. He is in fact not brunette. He’s  blonde and has blue eyes so I was a little far off. He’s sooooo cool and so sweet. He transferred  from UW like this semester but has lived in Austin his whole life. His dad’s a professor here in the  law department. He used to play high school football at Westlake and knows lots of guys on our  actual roster like wtf. He intercepted Quinn Ewers once                               that’s cool shit. And he has the cutest  smile I swear. We talked in the PCL for like 2 hours - did not feel that long - but yeah. And he got  us Jizza, which we ate in the dorm. Hannah was there so we talked too. We watched her do her  stats project for a whole hour which was so silly. Then she went down to get Jizza and on the way  back we saw Lauren!!! I love Lauren. So all of us went upstairs and talked. Hannah and Lauren  were the main ones talking to be so honest but I had lots of fun listening and I really hope Andrew  did too. And I’d look at him sometimes - he’s pretty, allow me - and he’d smile and it was so cute I  think I was melting a lil. I’m not even that much of a romantic person I feel. I do not catch feelings  easily but awwwww. He’s just so babygirl. But he could also throw me with one arm probably. Bro  is strong. And I feel like I connected w him more than I did w any other guy I’ve talked to. And  honestly this might sound so rude but it’s not the type of personality I’d expect from a football  player?? Like in my mind they’ve always been jocks, which ig that was the case in high school. I  was just never associated w them. Football players and cheerleaders. I feel like I’d get bullied it I  stepped within 3 feet of them. They’re scary bro. But Andrew is so sweet like…           I love his smile. Genuinely. He’s kinda perfect. Aside from all I’ve already gone through, he  also is quite literally my type. Blonde w blue eyes, but older than me but not more than a year. I  didn’t know this stuff before we talked btw so I’m not being shallow here. Literally thought he was  brunette bc my memory is shit. But yeah. We haven’t texted today, which I did think abt texting  him but I don’t want to seem overly attached?? Maybe I am but I don’t want to seem it?? I hope I  see him at the gym later. But we’ve planned to go watch Hannah and Lauren’s IM beach volleyball  playoff game on Sunday so that’ll be fun. Again. To reiterate. I am far from a romantic person in  my opinion. It takes me a long time to connect with people. This is so different though. It feels  right. Compared to my past experiences, at the least. Like with Jazhiel, I think we connected  well?? We had a good chat. And he was a sweetie too. After our ﬁrst chat I think I was kinda like  oh this could work?? And the second time we hung out I just lost those feelings. Not his fault. My  problem. Connor was cool to talk to. But he obviously wasn’t looking for something serious. And  he was a little creepy? Again my problem, he’s probably totally normal. He stared a lot. Idk. Noah  was just an asshole. On every front. Like bro. And he was also 24???? He told me that and I  literally should’ve walked out. I wasn’t even 20 at the time. It was insane. It literally ruined my day.  Especially since he has a nice insta so I really had high ish expectations. Anyways. But Andrew is  perfect. I’m telling you. He is so sweet. And we hugged before he left and                                            he’s so nice to  hug. I kinda love him. Awwww. There’s tons more details I’ve left out but that’s for another time.  He mentioned he liked sour patch kids (the watermelon ones) so I got him a bag at the jarket for  the next time we see each other. I just wanna lean my head on his shoulder bro. Like I kinda need  to sit on a sofa next to him and cuddle or something. Oh ew wow I sound gross rn. What is wrongw me. I’m gonna leave rn before I keep rambling lmao. Oh and one last thing. Noooo longer obsessed w Jude thank god. He’s so super cool and also so sweet but there was no way that was gonna work out. I think I just really thought he was cool af which he is. But yeah. Andrew love him!!!"
41,2024-04-17,"Alright update I love him                 ffsssss. He’s so sweet and so cute and so pretty!!!! For MLDS I had  to go pick up Potbelly’s and they accidentally gave me someone named Mariposa’s Uber Eats  order in addition to ours. I assume they thought it was utensils and that’s what I thought it was up  until I arrived at the EER and looked inside. But there were these 3 massive salads plus 2 full  sandwiches and 2 bags of chips and also a cup of chili. I lowkey felt so bad and was debating  returning it but it was so miserable outside plus I’d have to walk 15 minutes back and forth and it  wasn’t even my fault. And I ﬁgured by the time I’d realized they’d already started remaking the  order. So yeah I kept it. We were able to give away two salads at the meeting and I kept one. And  the sandwiches and chili and chips. Since Andrew and I hadn’t texted during the day I ﬁgured I’d  ask if he wanted to stop by for a sandwich if he was coming to Greg tonight and he agreed!! Lil  cutie. I ended up going to the gym at 9.15ish for leg day. Which by the way the Bulgarians have  been fully taking me out recently. I’ve had to go down bc 12.5 was not serving me well. But RDLs  have been great. Calf extensions too. Andrew was on his way here and ﬁnally got to Greg when I  was on the last set of my last exercise. He messaged saying he was in the free weight room so I  snuck up and sent him a picture of himself bc that’s always fun. He’d only just gotten there but he  said he’d lifted w his friends earlier on for TWO hours so he was just gonna do his 3 sets of  overhead presses and we could leave. Bro was doing 60s in each arm like holy shit                                           it’d be a  miracle if I even get to 20 someday. Him being strong asf is honestly so attractive I can’t even lie.  But yeah we headed up - we got some time to ourselves for like an hour bc Hannah was in the  shower. We heard her singing coming in which was cute. But we just sat on the rug and talked for  that hour. He laid down for a bit while I sat kinda looking over him which was cute. We’ve gotten a  tad more physical, just like kinda holding hands and stuff. Not fully. But I played w his hands a little  bc I tend to do that. We talked and it was cool. The conversation has gotten way more natural  now. Hannah came in later on and we started playing that game where we play a second of a  song and she guesses which one it is. She’s insane at Taylor swift songs. Like I’m a fan but fairly  casual at this point but she’s like incredible at this. Andrew and I took turns doing the song  pausing. He had his arm kinda on my leg so we could both see. But it was nice being so close to  him. We did that for like 2 whole hours for her                    then andrew did it for the strokes and he was  pretty good! Especially considering the strokes songs all sound quite similar, at least to me atm.  And then I did the game w waterparks and I lowkey did really well. I love them though so fair  enough right. Towards 3.30am - and yeah, we really did all stay up that late and it might’ve been a  bad idea bc I’m TIRED - andrew put his head on my shoulder whilst I was guessing which was  just so cute                 and his smile makes me melt bro like awhhh. Like yeah he could probably  throw me without a huge problem but he’s so babygirl too. And also. He smells way good too!!!  Aghhh I really like him man."
40,2024-04-18,"It’s dire out here folks I am down bad. Hung out w Andrew again tonight from like 11.40ish to  3.15am. We were texting about throughout the afternoon and                                     he’s so sweet omg I  can’t. I think we’re both a little obsessed w each other. I’m actually very obsessed w him. But yeah  he came over again after the gym and after watching Hannah volleyball for a bit. We played w this  silly ﬁdget toy for like a whole hour or something. And then Hannah was playing the guitar so we  just sat around and ended up cuddling. It was so comfy like it’s the best thing ever. I’d say I’m  pretty big on physical touch and o love hugs. He’s so much bigger than me and he’s so muscular  but he’s also so gentle when we cuddle                     which tbf in the dorm idk if it was cuddling  technically, I was just kinda hugging his arm and I ahd my head on his shoulder for a bit and he  had his arm around me, just stuff like that. Hannah played really well - and it was so peaceful I  was falling asleep. Around 2.40am Andrew had to head out and I walked him down as always. I  almost stopped where we usually do, but he seemed to want me to keep walking so I was like ok.  I asked where he’d parked and he asked if I wanted to go see and I was just like sure bc why not?  We walked down next to the stadium to a lil white car. We kinda hugged and then made out for an  extensive amount of time. It was my ﬁrst time, not sure how I did or even entirely how I feel abt it  but i think I liked it. And I really like him. We both wanted it and both went in for it. Maybe 65%ish  him. But I enjoyed it. And he’s not so tall that I have to like tiptoe to reach him or anything. I had  my arms around his broad ass shoulders and his hands were I think on my waist most the time.  Then we just hugged for like 10 whole minutes or something. He was so comfy. I’m sorry I couldn’t  let myself out of his arms. I just felt so safe. It was majestic. Like genuinely, his cuddles are  superior to anyone and everyone else’s. And then I ultimately was like agh I should go. And we  made out for another extensive amount of time. Hugged again maybe. He kinda played w my hair  and pushed it out my face as well, which was so sweet. We’d left around 2.45am and I got back at  like 3.15. I felt slightly weird"
39,2024-04-21,"Yeah update. Andrew and I have been texting a lot throughout the day recently. I haven’t seen him  since Thursday evening, which I don’t mind. We’ve already seen each other Monday through  Thursday so that’s more than enough especially just starting off. But I deﬁnitely really like him.  And I’m p sure he really likes me. I can’t say i quite understand why I’d even catch his eye in the  ﬁrst place, but I’m not gonna complain bc I really like him. He’s such a sweetie. And he’s cute af.  But also so strong and muscular so it’s a fun dynamic. Like he’d protect me if we ever needed it  but he’s also so gentle. I miss him and his cuddles. I think I’m gonna see him tmr so I’m excited  abt that. But uh. All that to say. I’m genuinely astonished it’s gone so well. We like each other.  He’s my type, and very much so. He’s so cool. And he’s older than me but not by a ton, which is  how I like it. He’s half a year older. His cuddlesssss. Like wowwww. To be fair I am just overall  touch starved so any cuddles are kinda great to me. But still. I just think we really might just end  up together. Obviously it’s not ofﬁcial yet and idk when a good time to make it ofﬁcial is. And idk  how it should be done. Idk if I’m ready for it just yet, we’d probs have to actually go on a date ﬁrst.  But like genuinely. Week or two from now I might actually have a boyfriend? Like whattt. That’s  kinda stressful ngl but I think I’m ready for it. And I really like him. I do. We also uhhh made out  again Thursday when I walked him out. It was nice. Anyways. Yeah that’s it I’m gonna sleep  goodnight."
38,2024-04-30,"Just remembered my dream from last night and I feel the urgent need to write it down before I  forget it again.     So I was in my databases class and I’d just gotten my quiz grade back or something but not the  actual quiz so I was like…I want my quiz. So I asked the TA and she was like oh yeah I have it just  come w me to my ofﬁce. And I was like okay. So I follow her out the classroom to this gorgeous  area with a glass spiral staircase and a whole ass waterfall?? And there was a plaque or sign that  said something Caitlin Clark. And then I look at the TA and I’m like holy shit. That’s Caitlin Clark.  My databases TA is Caitlin Clark. I opened my mouth and said something like wait you’re actually  Caitlin Clark…she was like yeah and I said oh I thought you just looked a lot like her                                      but then  we got to her ofﬁce and she gave me the quiz with her writing in red pen all over it. Then I think  we talked? She ultimately gave me a kinda foam volleyball with her autograph on it. And I was  walking out thinking oh my god I literally have a piece of paper full of Caitlin Clark’s handwriting…  and a ball with her autograph…and not only is she a basketball GOD, she also apparently knows  databases. Like what a queen. Wow."
37,2024-05-09,"Right so I haven’t journaled in ages but I wanted to write a lil before I sleep (it’s 4am). I want to  talk abt Andrew. I have, whether I like it or not, fallen for him and honestly quite hard. Bc he is truly  one of the sweetest people ever. The week before I left Austin we spent a good amount of time  together. On Friday we had a movie night with hannah and Lauren and he got us snacks from  HEB after a long shift at work which was just so                           and he was comprehensive with it too -  he got half a dozen donuts, whoppers, jolly rancher gummies, takis, and pop tarts…like aw. And  on Saturday afternoon he came over for a bit while I was packing to help out and to say goodbye.  I ended up not getting any packing done whilst he was here bc we were kinda just cuddling and  hugging and talking and kissing and shit. You understand. And when he was halfway to the door  abt to go he turned back and gave me another hug and we kissed and I think i knew i was truly  gone right then. We’ve been texting daily now that I’m 2.5 hours away. But he’s just so sweet…he  sends the sweetest messages and my stomach does that whole butterﬂy tingly thing. Tonight we  talked abt how texting is just so hard and it’s so easy to overthink things when the other party is  taking a bit to respond. He told me it is totally okay to double text and ask for reassurance…which  was so so kind. I’m an anxious person and idr if we talked abt that together before but truly  whenever anyone (much less someone I care so much for) takes a long time to respond I get so  anxious. Like what did I do. Do you hate me now? Has your view of me changed? It’s even worse  if that person is far away and you’re not gonna see them in person for a bit. You know? But yeah.  He’s the best. Idk how I got this lucky tbh. He’s so cute. So sweet, so kind. And such a cool  person. I love how levelheaded he is. I sound absolutely gone rn but I really do mean it. He’s also  just pretty…his hair his eyes his smile…yeah. Conventionally attractive for sure. Cuddling with him  is heavenly honestly. And hugging. As someone who loves hugs, his hugs are just too tier. First of  all bc he’s so cozy and secondly bc it’s him and I really do love him. I love rufﬂing his hair bc it  gets all ﬂat after it’s been under the hat all day and it’s so cute. God I’m unbearable rn. But I truly  don’t know how I got this lucky to meet him and to know him and to be friends with him, much less  to be in a romantic relationship (whatever this is??) with him. I don’t know what he sees in me.  Every day I think abt this. I will say that I think I have decent looks. Especially when I put in effort.  But overall I just feel like such a boring person. But he always engages in my interests and it’s just  so                 so yeah I’m down horrendously rn and have been all night. I miss him so much. I  miss being with him and being able to hug him and play with his hair and kiss him and more than  anything to just be with him. He has such a calming presence. Ffs man I really miss him. I hope  he visits bc I don’t think I can take this lmao. I just want to be with him rnnnnn. God I’m so down  bad this is so annoying!!!     It’s so weird to think that we can (and I really truly hope we do) end up as boyfriend and girlfriend.  It’s a little embarrassing to say that I’ve never been in a relationship before. But then again I was  not at all social in high school. Didn’t talk to anyone. On purpose. So that’s my bad. But yeah. If I  do get the privilege of being Andrew’s girlfriend, then truly wow. Alright I’m so so tired so ik gonna  sleep but just know that I do in fact have a heart! I do in fact fall in love with people, it’s just  extremely rare. Night!"
36,2024-06-10,"Aight. Haven’t journaled in forever. Kinda going through it atm. I’m in that part of summer where it  starts to suck bc I either have nothing to do or I have something to do but I don’t have the  motivation to do it. Before you ask, no I haven’t been taking my lexapro. Would it help? Probably.  But I cannot remember for my life to take it. And I’m not gonna get out of bed to take it rn. My  internship starts tmr. I’m nervous as shit, hence why I’m still awake rn. I’ve gotten zero info on  what I’m gonna be doing. I assume that’s gonna happen tmr but I rlly couldn’t tell ya. I’m at that  point in life where everything is kinda miserable and I feel like everyone hates me but also I hate  everyone too. At the same time I miss everyone so much. I miss Hannah. It’s so weird to…not talk  to her every day. Like I could for sure text her whenever I wanted just abt anything but it’s just  different texting. It’s hard to maintain a convo. I miss being in an environment where I can feel  productive and motivated. Bc at home I’m just in bed 80% of the day. Bc I quite literally can’t bring  myself to do anything. Also I should update abt Andrew too. We have def lost contact a little which  is fair, bc that always happens in the summer. The replies have gotten a lot slower though, which  lowkey freaks me out bc I’m scared he’s losing interest. Which tbf I wouldn’t blame him. Summer  things. It happens. I don’t want to ask bc it makes me too anxious. And I guess that’s how you  know you’ve fallen for someone, when you start tweaking over things like this. And it’s wrong  (imo) to expect constant communication, bc ﬁrst of all people have lives and I respect that. You  can’t be on your phone 24/7 and if you are you might have a problem. And second we aren’t  dating. It’s just that I’m someone who needs constant reassurance and so it kinda freaks me out  when I don’t get that and I’ve got too much time to overthink. I just want to know that he still likes  me is all. And I assume (or at least he, optimistically) that he is, since you technically doesn’t even  have to text me but does still choose to. And I’m lucky enough to be liked as is. Maybe I’m  gaslighting myself. Idk. I’m just gonna focus on myself over the summer though. Get going w the  internship. Lowkey I have sm to do and I’m so scared. The internship I assume should start up  slow ish. It always does. But I got promoted to co president for MLDS and we have to conduct  interviews soon. And I’m nervous abt that. Idk. I’m co president w Wendy and tbh she’s very very  responsible but not the type of person I work best with. She’s great and all, just too much like me.  Shy and not very decisive. And so I’ve taken on the decisive role of the two of us, which is kinda  nice tbh bc I feel like a leader. But I don’t want her to feel like she’s not also a leader. Idk. It’s ﬁne  it’s whatever. I believe in us. Room reservations. Fuck.     Nvm not a now problem. But yeah. That’s MLDS stuff. Oh also it was gonna be vidhi and Wendy  co presidents until I came along lmao which makes me feel splendid bc fuck vidhi. Idc. I won’t let  the grudge go. She’s been useless and does not deserve to co president at all. I do not like her.  Hope she fails a couple important classes. Anyways. Yeah that’s MLDS for ya.     Back to the Andrew topic bc I thought of something. He told me several weeks ago (when I was w  Hannah) that he hasn’t good w texting. He explained in several long messages that he had trouble  keeping in contact if the person he’s talking to isn’t physically there, which I def understand bcthat’s how it is for me to an extent as well. And he did emphasize that he still cared abt me, which I hope is still the case now. I can’t tell if we’re texting more or less than then tbh. It’s very random. And I try not to mind too much. He also did say that we’d probably inevitably lose our connection a little, which tbf fairs that happens w me and everyone over the summer. It just irks me a little that he doesn’t try harder? Which might be an asshole thing for me to say but let me speak. I don’t want to be the one trying harder for us. I don’t want to be clingy or be the only one to say I miss him. And I feel like it shouldn’t be as difﬁcult as it is to text back within like 3 hours. But then again, every time I think this I realize I don’t know everything abt him. Texting is hard and I get that, trust. So I’m like half frustrated half whatever abt it. Bc again I’m gonna focus on myself over the summer. If we lose our spark a little it’s okay, bc I trust we can rebuild it pretty quickly. I’m not concerned. And if we end up losing everything, oh well, it happens. New semester new beginnings. It’s chill and I’m not too worried. But it does however make me a lil sad that the ﬁrst couple weeks of break it was perfect. I’d get the sweetest daily compliments and we texted a lot… but also I realize it’s easy to burn yourself out w texting. So I’m not peeved. Just wanted to bring that up.    Okay. New topic. Just to procrastinate bedtime a lil more. Recently I’ve gotten into the very weird habit of scrolling r/spiders each night before bed. I can’t really explain it. I’m terriﬁed of spiders. I’d call it mild to mid arachnophobia. Not severe but I don’t appreciate those guys at all. But every night now I go to the subreddit and scroll for like an hour. Mainly the hot posts of the day or week, and the comments. Most posts are ppl asking for an ID on some spider they’ve seen. And it makes me so happy that the energy of the subreddit is just someone posting a picture of a spider and someone replying w the full scientiﬁc name of the spider in question. That’s delightful stuff. It’s so cute. I’ve actually learned a lot abt spiders recently. And I’ve gotten somewhat proﬁcient at identifying a few of them. I can generally identify brown recluses, which are the type of spider you DONT want in your house bc they have a medically signiﬁcant bite and are honestly quite terrifying. But their identifying mark is this violin-like pattern on their thorax. There’s this one post I absolutely love. I’ve saved the link to it and everything. But it’s this person who posted a picture of a perfect brown recluse who is obviously massively pregnant (gravid) saying that these spiders were everywhere in their garage and they wanted a deﬁnite ID. The comments are so fun to read every time. I’ve also learned to kinda identify wolf spiders, who carry their young on their back which is half adorable half creepy af. They have vertical stripes. I’ve seen lots of orb weaver spiders, who I can’t quite identify but I think they’re cool and the general characteristic I’ve picked out is that their abdomen is quite patterned. I’ve seen lots of jumping spiders too, and this is probably the only spider type I’d call cute. Genuinely they are adorable. Wouldn’t be so cute if one of them were crawling on me, but they really are so cute in all the pictures. I’ve seen camel spiders a couple times. And also this weird and very creepy spider called a greenfang tube something. Tubeweb. Those shits are terrifying. I’ve learned that the daddy long legs that we used to have in Shanghai are cellar spiders. Colloquially daddy long legs, but also several species (including one that isn’t even technically a spider) are called daddy long legs. Lowkey I think cellar spiders creep me out more than wolf spiders. It’s the long ass legs for sure. Hate it. I think that’s abt it. But yeah I’ve learned a lot, and idk why I’m so obsessed w this now. I’d still freak if I say any of the aforementioned spiders in my room or really anywhere near me. Maybe if I saw themoutdoors I wouldn’t freak out but indoors I for sure would. The one downside to this new ﬁxation is that I get hyperparanoid abt spiders being in my living space. Like under the toilet, or on my bed. Every time I itch at all I fear it’s a spider. Doesn’t help that I searched up brown recluse infestations today and learned that Houston is a popular location for them. I kinda want to see one outdoors tbh. Like that’d be cool, but indoors I might cry. I’ve also gotten into the r/fossils subreddit bc I forget how much I love and want to get into paleontology. Sadly I haven’t learned much if anything. The names of everything are too hard to remember. But yeah. Reddit updates. Funny.    I think I should sleep now. So yup goodnight!"
35,2024-06-12,"Alright here I am for another venting journaling experience. I’m listening to the nbhd rn and tbh it’s  absolutely transformational. I haven’t listened to them properly in so long. Like all their albums  instead of just the select songs in my chill playlist. I’ve been slightly obsessively checking lastfm  just bc I like music stats and honestly it’s surprising how much I listen to the nbhd without realizing  it though. Bc they’re actually my second listened to artist of all time somehow. Anyways. So good.  But let me get to my complaining in a bit after I decide to end this heavenly music session.     Okay I’ve come. So I just wanted to complain and be upset but lowkey I’m really tired so I might  just sleep and not do what I said I’d do. I’ve been upset all day bc work has been stressing me out  immensely and I have nobody to talk to abt it comfortably with. Bc I have no friends. At school I  actually feel like I have friends and ppl who care abt me but here I’m just all alone and it’s actually  doing horrors to my mental health. Nobody is responding to my texts and I just talk to myself on  Twitter all day like how fucking stupid is that? It reminds me so much of COVID summer when I  was absolutely going through it. one of the worst times of my life bc I was genuinely having  intense cry sessions and self harming at night and it was horrid. Also reminds me of several years  back, 2019-2020ish, when I’d be mentally destroyed if I didn’t receive happy birthday messages  from my old friends. I’m big on birthdays and I love wishing ppl happy birthday. I set reminders  (accounting for time zones) to send messages. So when I realize I’m the only one putting in effort  in the friendship, as in, I’m the only one wishing the other party a happy birthday…that shit used to  take me out completely. I’d cry over it and it genuinely destroyed me. I’d cry over having no  friends. And it’s bothering me so much rn bc I thought I had friends and ppl who care abt me but  okay whatever ig tf not. I think starting tmr I’ll just keep myself on work focus mode all day and  ignore incoming messages. Just work, and scroll twitter at most. Like damn if you’re not gonna  reply to my shit I won’t reply to you guys either if I ever hear back. I hate appearing desperate. I  hate one sided relationships. Idk why ppl have a problem w responding quickly. I probably seem  overly eager a lot of the time but in reality I just don’t see a problem w responding quick. I enjoy  texting ppl bc I appreciate that they enjoy talking to me but damn ig they don’t after all. Idc. It’ll just  be me and my work stuff tmr. And I’ll probably keep track of Twitter yk bc awsten. he announced  hiidef popups today so u wanna stay updated on that. and euros start so soon so I want updates  there too. so yeah. Fuck everyone man I’ll just be alone for life in everything. you know I’m in a  bad mental state when I start listening to my sad Spotify playlists. I have like 6 sad playlists which  is a lot and they overlap but I cba to combine them and I basically only listen to them when I am  fried and today I was fried. listened to my alone playlist. Actually quite proud of that one. the  picture I used as the cover is nighthawks by Edward hopper bc that painting gives me those alone  vibes. in my mind the guy in the center is the main character and there are ppl near him but I  imagine him feeling alone like I do. around people who don’t care abt him. I miss trus man. I think  abt this a lot. we had so many insightful convos and lots abt art. Even if at times I was just  humoring him I did learn. and I hate that we ended things on bad terms. but yeah I’d gone through  a phase of being a little annoyed by him and some of his views which ig came through in my  responses. And I was probably talking abt my love life too much. either way I miss our deeperconvos and also our music talks and art talks. and footy. hope he’s well. truly. anyways. I’m so tired but I wanna keep complaining so I start all fresh tmr. Idk. I’ve put myself back on lexapro and I’m hoping i get back into the habit of it bc my anxiety has been crippling recently ngl. I was actually physically hyperventilating yesterday and today which was so weird. So yeah I’m back on lexapro. I’ve wanted to start back up w the gym but I end my work day so late and I want time after for myself to rot in bed so I haven’t gone the last 2 days. And idk what to do. I think I’ll go Friday and the weekend but the gym also closes earlier those days. another option is for me to start my days earlier and end earlier so I have more time to myself before gym if I want to keep my og schedule. I’ll think it through. Ok I’m exhausted I’m gonna dip. Just letting it be known that today sucked and I feel unloved lonely and burdensome socially, and useless and stupid overall bc work is so hard. Okay goodnight."
34,2024-06-14,"I’m gonna sleep in a few and I was gonna tweet this but thought it’d be better here. I was just  gonna say. I genuinely don’t understand why people respond to texts late asf. I’m far from a social  butterﬂy. But I have no problem responding to peoples’ texts quickly. Generally within the hour, but  mostly within 20 minutes. But then they take hours or even fuckass days to respond to me each  time which then pushes me to respond slower so I don’t seem desperate or like I have zero life.  Which doesn’t even make sense bc I don’t need to have zero life to respond to texts. It doesn’t  take that long folks. I don’t understand why you’d treat someone you consider a friend like that yk?  Every time someone, anyone I care for messages me I feel happy bc they’ve thought of me for  whatever reason. And I want to talk to them. I cannot believe that others don’t feel the same. In  fact nobody seems to. Not a single soul texts me back man like what am I doing wrong. Literally  nothing. It’s pissing me off but I also don’t have the restraint to simply not answer them. And  honestly I hate to say it without knowing more info (and apologies in advance if there are  extenuating circumstances) but Andrew has been pissing me off, bro messages me once a day in  the afternoon or even evening, but he’s been asking questions so I have to answer that, and then  he doesn’t fuckin respond till the next day. What the fuck am I supposed to take from that? If you  want to end the conversation and stop talking to me just do that. I don’t understand why he isn’t  just doing that if he’s lost interest. Luckily I’m not too emotional over it, just annoyed and a little  pressed. I don’t understand how he went from replying within 20 minutes and texting all day and  complimenting me every day to this. Sure, I understand if people aren’t great texters. It’s ﬁne.  Won’t say I’m a good texter either. But I think that you should put in effort if you’re talking to  someone you like. If you want to maintain a relationship. And honestly I should’ve made that more  clear when he mentioned it but oh well. I still can, I just have been busy w work. It’s occupied me  emotionally. Which is NOT hypocritical bc I still text him back quickly even whilst working and he  doesn’t. But yeah. If it’s brought up and if I deem it suitable I can stress the situation more. Idk  how I feel just yet. Mainly bcc cc we aren’t dating and so technically I shouldn’t press. Ffs. Ah  whatever. I’ll focus on work. This is such a side issue, it just frustrates me and it’s easy to vent abt.  Goodnight."
33,2024-06-30,"Well. So this is gonna be an emotional journey. And I’m ready to cry so let’s do it. Long story short  I ended things w Andrew. Or did he end it with me? I don’t fuckin know and honestly I don’t care.  Key is that we are over and done. And I am absolutely broken over it. Not so much about the  losing him part, surprisingly. So I mentioned before that we started texting a lot less. It started in  mid May I think. We’d still text every day but he’d take a few hours to respond. And when June  rolled round and when I started work he basically texted once a day. And this week we messaged  Thursday and then he never responded. At that point I was tired of being worried every day so I  messaged hannah and explained things and asked her what to do. She suggested I talk to him,  which was what I’d ﬁgured was gonna have to happen. But I just needed someone to say it to my  face. So I sent him a message (a pretty good one, dare I say) telling him I didn’t appreciate our  lack of communication and that he needed to tell me if he’d lost interest so I could move on.  Otherwise, ﬁx up or it’s not worth my time and effort either. He responded this morning, saying  that yeah, he had been communicating poorly bc he wanted to “hold onto me as a friend”? Bc  otherwise if he cut things off we’d never speak again? I lowkey didn’t know what that meant. But  you know, it was clear he’d lost interest. Which def pierced my heart at ﬁrst even though I  expected it. I told him we probably should stay on our sides of the world. Why in the fuckin world  would I still want to be his “friend”? But I messaged hannah and Alex. Hannah was so quick to  respond and talking to her helped me so much bc honestly I was distraught. And Alex responded  around noon, and we kinda just talked it over. Bc ofc I was upset but more so I was just confused.  If all andrew wanted was a ﬂing, why would he put that much effort into it at ﬁrst? We hung out so  much. Like so much. Hours every day or every other day for a few weeks. Even when he was  busy and had just came from work. I mean I’m just saying, if I wanted a mere ﬂing w someone that  I wasn’t interested in long term, I wouldn’t spend that much time w them. Like ok, sure, we made  out…a decent amount. And cuddled. A lot. But is that seriously worthwhile? And literally on the  day I left, he came to see me and was all like well talk every day, I look forward to you being back,  maybe I’ll visit you in Katy, blah blah blah. And he proceeded to text wonderfully for the ﬁrst  couple weeks of break. And then it stopped abruptly. So his explanation doesn’t make sense to  me, the thing abt him not wanting anything. Bc genuinely why would you go to all that effort? He’s  an attractive guy. Tallish, jacked, blonde w blue eyes, and overall attractive. He could easily get  another girl over the summer. So why’d he even attempt to keep our connection if he wasn’t  genuinely interested? Alex says it’s bc he could see that I was holding onto the relationship  despite him backing off. Which okay that’s true but we were each giving the same amount of effort  at the beginning of summer I’d say. So truly I don’t get it. Maybe he met another girl. But then  why’d he still keep talking to me? Like sure as an alternate okay I guess that’s possible, but if I  met someone better and I knew I’d lost interest in my previous … person I’d just let them know?  And not keep letting them think I was interested still??? He also could’ve just lost interest over the  break. Which I get. But that’s not what he said. So I don’t get it. Idk why I’m mulling over this part  of the situation lmao. But my curious mind wants to know what his fuckin deal is. Then again,  maybe he really was just looking for someone to kiss and cuddle with. He’d say he’d take me out  for dinner and never did that. But my naive self just saw past that at the time bc why should I  believe he was faking everything?Let’s get to the sadder part. I’ll probably cry. I just…it hurts me a lot, I can’t lie. Because you know I was pretty down bad for him. When things started out, it was legitimately perfect. A charming guy, my type perfectly on paper. Athletic, muscular, blonde w pretty eyes, well spoken. And kind. Approached me on the bicep curl machine and had me so quickly. We talked for the ﬁrst time properly at PCL and connected well. He was a good guy and I knew when I went to bed that night that this might be good. Fast the fuck forward to now and I hate this guy for playing with my feelings and wronging me like this. It’s been just over 2 months since we met. When I left Austin, I truly believed that we were going to end up together. As boyfriend-girlfriend, as Ken says in Barbie. A month in, that hadn’t changed. The next month it started falling off, but it didn’t shatter my hopes. It’s just that I put so much time, effort, and emotion into this relationship - whatever it should be called - only for it to not pay off. And that’s always been my story, hasn’t it. It’s always the damn same. I moved here from Shanghai, and had the hardest time making friends. No matter what I tried, nothing would work out. I did everything to try and make even a single friend and nobody gave a shit abt me. I starved myself and left school for months for treatment, and nobody gave a shit. It destroyed me mentally and has altered my brain chemistry permanently. I did everything I could to be like other people - to have a friend group, to be able to text someone when I needed help with homework, to have someone to hang out with. But I never had that. To this day there’s nobody in Katy that I can simply call up and hang out with. And every time I come home I’m reminded of that. Of the fact that I’m painfully alone and it’s been 7 years and it’s never going to change. No matter what I try. I just don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. I know I’m not the most outgoing person. Not the most attractive, not the most intelligent. But I can’t be that bad at life, can I? Junior high at beckendorff and high school at seven lakes was simply hell. Going through each day basically without saying a word to anyone…I can’t believe I lived like that. At a point you know I gave up. Around high school. I gave up on trying to make friends, bc it wasn’t ever gonna happen and I’d already gave my everything. And I listen to hannah and everyone else’s high school stories, and they talk abt how they’d be hanging out every day, going to prom, blah blah when I couldn’t have any of that. Nobody would’ve gave half a little rat’s ass if I just fucking collapsed and died in the middle of the hall. Group projects still traumatize me, bc every time we had to get in groups, I was that one person without a group and I’d have to go around asking people if i could join theirs. People never liked me, and I truly never understood why. Okay, I have friends now. Friends who I am eternally grateful for and would do anything for. Hannah and her friends who are now my friends - Sydney, Kenadi, Lauren. And then Alex. Not much quantity- wise, but something. Hannah means so much to me and is the reason why I’m doing so well in college mentally. I don’t know what I’d do without her. Genuinely. And this experience w Andrew haunts me and shatters my heart so much because that spring was genuinely my favorite semester ever. Socially I was thriving. I was going to the gym, I loved my classes and was doing great in them, and I’d just met this guy who made it clear he really liked me and I also reciprocated that. I put so much into that connection with him and now I’ve been told it was never going to be anything. And it makes me feel like I’m in junior high again - All my friends are far away and living their own lives and I shouldn’t bother them w my problems. I’ve tried so hard to build this relationship only for it to go nowhere. And now I’m just painfully alone again, crying in my room with just a journal to comfort me. It’s the exact same situation that drove me to absolute madness in junior high. Feeling completely and utterly unlovable. And like all my effort doesn’tmatter. And it hurts so much also bc I feel like I had it all in that last month at school. Friends and a guy that I’d hit it off with. And now I have nothing. I’m alone. And lonely. It hurts me so much. And I hate that this breaks me so easily. It’s just a stark reminder that in the end I’m really nobody’s ﬁrst choice. Will I ever be? Fuck knows. This whole ordeal also highlights to me that people are really just so much more convoluted than I’ll ever know. I’d say I’m generally a pessimist, leaning more towards optimist these days, but I try to see the best in people. Mainly people that I meet and know personally. I always assume that they are telling the truth. And that they wouldn’t intentionally put me or anyone else they (allegedly) cared about through harm or stress. Which is why it just bafﬂes me as to why Andrew would drag this whole thing on for so long after he knew he’d lost interest. I simply cannot fathom it. Was it that hard to just tell me? I don’t know, but I don’t think I deserved that. To be made to believe he still liked me, and that it wasn’t a one sided relationship that I was carrying. Maybe he liked the attention, but then I would’ve thought he’d text back more often. It truly confuses me. Why do people do that? Intentionally drag things on for their own beneﬁt when they know it’ll really hurt the other party. It literally does not make sense. I don’t think I’ll ever understand it. But what I do know is that I’m really hurt. I hate knowing that I was the pawn in this guy’s game. And now I’ll have to start all over again, and then what if this happens again? But the one thing I have learned from this is to be careful. Make sure to ask the other party’s long term intentions early on. Don’t rush to, you know, kissing and cuddling. Get key communication aspects down. I just hope I ﬁnd someone who doesn’t take advantage of my purity and belief in people. Because this really hurts. Another part of why it hurts is that he did make me feel less alone. I had someone to talk to every day. But now I don’t. And now I also know he didn’t give a shit. It’s all just tough and I want to bash my head open on the wall. I don’t know how to feel and what to believe anymore. I just want to sleep forever. Wake up from this never ending nightmare. It’s like oh, life has been perfect since college started bc I actually have good friends now! And then I come home over the summer and lose everything. And I’m back to square one. And i feel like that 7th grade Jasmine again. Sitting at the group table in English class with these popular blonde girls who scorned me. Going to band and being the one person in the saxophone section everyone looked down on, and that one student Ms. Holding hated and picked on bc I hadn’t gone through beginner band and didn’t know all the conventions of concert band. I didn’t get a book of scales and was too afraid to ask and she made me get up in front of class to go get one when she found out. I feel like I’m once again 7th grade Jasmine who had nowhere to sit at lunch, bc everyone else already had their friend groups and I was just…alone. I’d walk several circles around the cafeteria looking for an empty table. I was eventually invited to sit w this girl Natalie and her friends, but they all thought I was off bc I wouldn’t speak to them. I was shy and freaked out. I’m sorry. And that’s around when I stopped buying lunches and just started bringing ziplock bags of stuff like raisins and pecans. Which then devolved into a single granola bar. That I’d nibble on for 20 minutes to sustain me till dinner. That’s who I feel like rn. And it’s terrible. Because it was the worst time of my life and I can say I’ve recovered from the eating disorder but the feeling that I’m alone seems to never go away. I always come back to it. In some way or another. The grift has been healed for so long and then this whole thing happened which has just destroyed me. It’s so hard to get over when all I can do rn is to mull over it and to soak in my sorrow. I just don’t know anymore. It hurts. It really does. I’m sorry for ever believing things would get better. For believing that when someone tells me he thinks I’m pretty and would drop anything and everything to spend time with me, he really meantit. For believing that I’d ever ﬁnd someone who’d consider me their ﬁrst choice. I’m fucking sorry, god forbid I believe in compassion and humanity and be optimistic in life. Anyways. I’m gonna fuck off outta here and just…I dunno, consume mindless content for an hour. Goddamn."
32,2024-07-01,"well it’s day two of uhh the healing process? and again it’s been tough and it kinda hindered me  all day but it’s whatever it’s Monday. I looked forward to going to the gym tonight all day (which is  such bitchless behavior, by the way) and I went and had a great workout but this was really the  ﬁrst one where I knew for certain I wasn’t get a text from Andrew. gym tends to be a prime texting  time. You know. And I found myself checking my phone btwn sets…but checking what? I wasn’t  getting texts from anyone            all the notifs I get are just Sofascore notifs. But yeah it got me a littl  upsetty spaghetti as they say. And seeing these jacked white guys around also made me think of  him…        which is so lame and embarrassing but hey, the fact that he was ﬁt was a big source of  attraction for me. Holding onto his bicep? Okay yeah, I’ll admit it, that was good shit. Lmao. Do i  miss it? Oh yeah. Also the cuddles and hugs were wayyyy good too bc again he’s a well built guy,  and it was just comforting. Made me feel safe even though now he’s made me feel like I should  kinda maybe jump off a cliff bc I’m never gonna ﬁnd love. And I’m still genuinely curious as to  what changed. I’m almost positive he was interested to start out. Because no way he’d put in that  much work otherwise, come on now. He was putting in more work and emotion than I was for a  bit. He listened to the music I recommended…texted me such genuine things (that face it, if you  weren’t interested in me, would you even notice or remember those things?), spent hours upon  hours with me…like come on now. You cannot convince me his intentions were originally bad. And  the guy I fell for was that guy. It eventually just fell off over the summer, and I really do wonder  why it all abruptly stopped. I mean I think it’s not a bad hypothesis to say he met someone else?  And was saving me as an alternative? Bc I mean as a touch starved person myself I can  somewhat understand the need to ﬁnd someone who can fulﬁll that void. But yeah man I dunno.  And probably I’ll never know. Just speculation forever I suppose. It’s chill though. Well really it’s  not. But whatever.     It’s all just so annoying. And obviously I have so much more in life rn to occupy myself with and to  look forward to, but fuckin hell this experience has been unpleasant. Would I rather it not have  happened? Lowkey no, it’s a learning experience. And I got cuddles and kisses out of it so                              and  it’s an ego boost to know that I was able to attract my type. Bc genuinely bro was my type  (physically) perfectly on paper. Blonde blue eyed attractive ﬁt guy who is a few months older than  me. That’s why the initial attraction phase went so well. He had me pretty quickly. But yeah. Lil  ego boost. Yep, the type of guy I ﬁnd attractive also can ﬁnd me attractive. I’ll take it. I got to get  called pretty for like a month. That was nice. Bahahahah. Hey I’ll take what I can get. Plus I got to  practice kissing. It was fun I’m not gonna sit here and lie to you. Just wish I knew from the  beginning that it would end up being a situationship. See, I also learned that asking what the other  person’s intentions are on the ﬁrst date is so important. Now we know! I have learned a good deal.  Cheers. Now we just gotta…uhhh…ﬁnd someone else who happens to not be a proper asshat. I  guess I’m lucky in that I have reasonably alright looks. Gets my foot in the door. But idk, it’s not  like I pull a ton. And yeah sure I guess if I saw someone I was really attracted to, I could make the  ﬁrst move, but that’s really not my thing for two reasons. One, because that’s not how I function - ifI see someone attractive I really only will be like “oh, they’re attractive, good for them” and I won’t think to pursue anything. Two, because my type is simply the type of person who approaches me ﬁrst. The risk taker who knows how to be direct and make their intentions clear. So yeah, I guess me not being an approacher slims my chances down. But ahhh whatever. See the issue now is that bc I’ve felt how nice it is to feel loved (even if I actually wasn’t lmao), I crave that feeling. And also physical affection. I think my love language may be physical affection. Which is weird bc I wouldn’t have expected that. I’m not a super touchy person and sometimes I’m not super into people being physical w me. But I mean it’s diff if it’s in a romantic and loving context. Anyways. Uhh. So seeing as I’m already talking future relationships that may or may not ever happen, maybe I am getting over this fairly quickly. I didn’t cry today. I mean there were moments where I nearly did. But mainly bc I was also listening to sad music. Either way. Yeah and there were times when I felt miserable bc I realized I was pitifully alone again. But overall this isn’t as bad as it could be, you know? And at least I had fun at the time. I’m in more of a vengeful, angry mood today. Yesterday was just sadness. I know I won’t be running back to him for sure, which is reassuring. There is no appeal to a man who led me on and threw me a bunch of lies. Half of me (okay, more than half of me) does wish he’d text. Be like “I’m sorry I treated you the way I did” or “take me back please I realized I made a terrible mistake”. Just so I can respond and be like “what the fuck do you want” and also just get a better explanation than I was given. Whatever the fuck he told me made no sense. I badly want a better explanation but obviously I’m not gonna text him. Anyways. Praying for whichever girl is uhhh next on his roster. Maybe I’m gullible and too willing to believe in the goodness of people but damn he got me pretty good! Gotta respect it!! And anyways, like I was saying earlier I’ve learned a lot from this, and it’s all gonna help in future relationships. And it’s a good experience to have in the books. Some lore to make me interesting. Lmao. Am I over him? No. Nah. Not yet. But I am however seeing the light in the darkness. I just gotta trust that I will someday ﬁnd love ahahahaha. I’m gonna be pretty miserable for a few more days but I’m doing well, considering. I’m basically just at where I am socially I’m any other summer. It just really sucks bc I had all those high expectations (NEVER a good idea, by the way) just for them to come crashing down on me. And for everything to just be the same as it always is during the summer. Yeah whatever. Okay. Fine. I’ll accept that things don’t always go the way I want it even when I was so sure it would.    The good thing about ending this whole sticky shabang is that I genuinely don’t have to stress abt it anymore. I’m not confused abt how he’s feeling. I mean yeah sure I’ve no clue what the actual truth is, but I really don’t care. I’m chillin. Working. Making some money. Spending time w family. Watching the Euros. All that. I can do that without the shroud of uncertainty over the whole situation w him. So that’s lovely. Gotta love it."
31,2024-07-08,"alright well I’m having a splendiferous start to the week. We got hit by a tropical storm/hurricane  (idk what it is rn) and lost power so I can’t work bc there’s no internet. Nothing on my phone so I  can’t even send an email or a text message. Which is so lame bc last night when we still had  internet I was like oh maybe I should send a heads up message to everyone telling them this  might happen. But I thought nahh no need we’re not gonna lose power and I’m gonna look like a  proper idiot. But no. Fine. Now I also look like a proper idiot. Fairs. I deserve that. But yep I quite  literally cannot do anything rn. Everything I do that is important to me either recreationally or work  related basically requires the internet. The sole exception is listening to music, I guess. Since I’ve  got songs downloaded. But yeah. So I’ve got no clue what to do rn. I could read but it’s kinda dark  in the room. Can’t turn on lights, remember. My plan is just to keep sleeping I guess. In small  increments of time so that I can check every once in a while if the power is back. I feel like such  an idiot bc we still had power at like 6am but my ﬁrst thought was to send a tweet out saying wow  it is storming hella outside! And then we lost power and I tried replying to the tweet and it didn’t  go. So yeah, having          time truly. It’s annoying tho bc I literally drank my protein coffee already so  I’m caffeinated and not sleepy. Maybe a little sleepy. But like not that sleepy. And I hate wasting  my energy like that. But honestly what else can I even do. If I keep journaling I’m gonna run out of  battery and I can’t even charge my phone. I think I can still program on my laptop (taylyrics)  although I won’t be able to run the app to check my changes so really that’s just lame. And also I  can’t charge my laptop and it’s only at 60% rn. Damn this is a time. Well really the only thing I can  do is go to sleep and wait. I’ve tried sending an email to Bruno but naturally it won’t send. I hope  he knows that this storm is happening, but idk how hopeful I am abt that bc I lowkey didn’t know it  was coming until yesterday. This sucks man. Well. Maybe I can take this time to uhhh journal abt  my feelings and emotions and such but I also don’t wanna use up all my battery. At 9am. But you  know what I think it’d be good for me.    So yeah let’s have it. I’ve been okay lately. Really haven’t been thinking abt Andrew that much.  Occasionally yeah I’ll get hit by waves of sadness that it all happened like it did, but at this point  I’m content for the most part. It’s like okay yeah, I liked this guy a lot, but I’ve learned more abt  who he is now and I realize that’s not who I should be with. Plus I learned a ton and I can apply  that to any future relationship. For example I learned that making our intentions clear on the ﬁrst  date or ﬁrst few dates is so important. Just to make sure we are both on the same page. And I  learned how to kiss better lmao. Which, by the way, I did in fact enjoy that so you know what  Andrew I’m not even mad. I learned that long distance fucking sucks and I should avoid that at all  costs. I learned that I reallyyyyy love cuddles and hugs and playing w peoples’ hair. And honestly I  think I’m better at making small talk and not being boring as hell too. So yeah, a ton of valuable  info that I will be taking advantage of. Do I miss Andrew? Yeah I do. I miss that security he gave  me for the most part. Both physical and emotional. Him being this strong big guy (compared to  me) was such an attractive thing to me bc as an anxious person I like being close to someone  who can protect me physically. I’m just a girl you know. And also having him there for me was so  good emotionally too bc it’s so so nice to be able to message someone throughout the day, just toupdate them abt little things I’m doing. And he’d send me the sweetest things man. Idk what happened but I don’t appreciate it. And I just liked knowing that I was a big part of his life. And that he liked me. And I liked him. But oh well. That’s all gone then. But I think the main reason why it’s been hurting me so much is bc I don’t understand why everything went to shit. And so I’ve really been trying to understand. And I was able to come up with a theory that I’m satisﬁed with after talking to Eric and Alex. Our idea is that he was interested at ﬁrst in a relationship and really did care for me, but a few weeks into summer he was realizing that the lack of physical intimacy accompanying the texts was draining him and burnt him out. And that maybe he didn’t like me as much for me, and just liked the feeling of being with someone he found (hopefully) attractive. And then he might’ve found some other girl who he could be physical with and kept me as a backup. But that last part is ofc straight theory. Just saying though, bro is attractive and he would have no trouble pulling another girl. But yeah, that’s what we think. What I think. And now that I’m satisﬁed with that theory I haven’t been as upset. I still miss being affectionate and close with someone romantically, but oh well. I think when we ﬁrst ended things I was more upset abt losing our connection like that - all that emotional effort I put in just for nothing to come of it. And the fact that I’d been lied to and manipulated really fucked w me. But now I’m more upset bc I’m lonely. But I also do have Hannah, which has been so therapeutic. I love her so much. And I guess I’ll have to go again next semester, but that’s okay. To be so honest I’ve been looking really good today. Maybe it’s bc the room is dim but I look great. Hopefully I can still pull. Lmao. And it still makes me glad that I was able to pull someone who is fully my type on paper. He was, physically, my type to a tee (whatever the saying is). The fact that he was a big football player had me so good. But yeah, nice to know I look good enough to pull that. Hopefully I can do that again but w a better person next semester. I sound so shallow rn. But you know what I mean. After being so close w him for so long and then having it all stripped from me has been so lonely. And I really crave connection. And I want to love someone deeply and have them love me back the same way. I feel like I have so much love in my heart despite everything and I want to give that to someone, you know? Obviously I give it to Hannah bc she is the love of my life but I also want to give that to someone romantically. But yeah honestly I’ve been feeling a ton better abt it lately. Something clicked and now I don’t feel miserable abt what went down. And I don’t even feel that mad at him. Like okay he was a dick, but I also kinda feel that he wasn’t all there mentally. And I’m not gonna spite him for that. And I’m not gonna retaliate. It’s just a learning experience and I will take that. Do I kinda hope that karma bites him in the ass? Oh yeah. I deﬁnitely do. But I don’t hate him. And I don’t think he hates me. We just lost the spark and the connection and that’s ﬁne. It’s not like a traumatic thing where if I see him I’ll get all upset. I actually would not even mind seeing him at Greg. I guess I told him I didn’t want to be friends anymore, but if I did see him at Greg I can’t say I wouldn’t wave and smile. I hate breaking connections. Even if maybe things didn’t go the way at one or both of us wanted, I don’t want to cut off all contact, you know? I’d want to keep being somewhat friends. As in I won’t block people unless they were a genuine piece of shit. And if I saw them somewhere I’d still wave at them. As someone who hasn’t had many friends ever, I really do cherish any relationships I have. And I guess that’s why this whole thing w Andrew hit me hard at ﬁrst. But once I understand the whole thing it really puts my mind at ease. Idk why I keep rambling on and on abt this. I’m milking it for sure, but also I think I deserve to. Yes it’s been over a week, but like let me be. Sometimes I do wonder how much he thinks abt me. I doubt it’s anywhere close to how much I think abt him. But that’s whatever. It’s something I’ve come to accept. I wonder if he ever regrets how he treated me, or even just starting things w me in the ﬁrstplace. I really wanna know what his thoughts are. But obviously I’m not texting him. Sometimes I wish he’d text me again. Okay not even sometimes, lowkey a lot of times. Even now. There’s the twinge of hope that okay maybe he’ll text me just to talk. Ask how I’m doing. Or to apologize for his actions. Or better, ask to have me back, to which I’d resist the urge to say yes and tell him to fuck off or something. Idk man. And it does scare me, bc idk who I’ll ﬁnd next romantically. Like what if they’re also a dick and I’m too naive to see it. Or if it’s another Jazhiel situation where he is so sweet but I am truly not attracted to him. But to be so honest, I think the whole thing w Andrew progressed so quickly partly bc the thrill of having someone like me and being able to be affectionate w them kinda shadowed some of the ﬂaws I could already kinda feel early on. Like yes, he was a sweetie early on. Almost perfect. But we had been talking in person for like a month and we hadn’t been on a proper date. Like in a restaurant. Even though he’d said he would take me. And admittedly maybe he wasn’t the best communicator even early on. But I was so head over heels that I was willing to overlook that. And I guess next time I shouldn’t ignore my instincts. Again, another lesson I’ve learned. It’s nice how I can talk abt all this now without being upset. It’s just like damn, that happened and that was unfortunate, but it’s okay.    Alright let me end that whole discussion up there and uhh get back to this whole tropical storm situation. It’s 11am now and we still have no power no internet no nada. Jiant and I drove out to ﬁnd somewhere w better signal and I was able to send a couple emails out to Bruno explaining the situation. We went out whilst the eye was passing through Katy, so it was calm. It’s all ramped back up now though. I’m draining so much battery by journaling but look I really have nothing else to do. I can read but I kinda don’t want to. lol. So I think I’m gonna stop and take a nap. Yep. So long."
30,2024-07-09,"Well hello folks I have returned for a midnight journaling session. We still don’t have power. But it’s  been a fun day I’d say. We played poker pretty much the entire afternoon, from like 1pm to 5pm.  And then we drove out for a spin and got notice that                           外公外婆         ’s place had power and internet and  everything, so we had dinner there and I charged my phone and chatted for a long time w                                                外公     .  Then we got back home and it was so interesting bc it was pitch black. And obviously this has  happened before w the winter storms but it’s still always a fascinating experience yk. But yeah.  We showered and then played poker again from around 10 to 11.30pm. So yep that’s been my  day. Super productive, I know. And it’s so silly how we’ve been out of power for so long bc the  storm was gone after like 1pm latest. And then it got all bright and beautiful outside. So yeah it just  feels so dramatic to not be able to do anything. But tomorrow tho it’ll be ﬁne. Bc I’m going to work  w Jiant and it’s gonna be all normal. I haven’t been in the medical center in forever so I’m kinda  excited. And I enjoy the drive to the city bc I get to listen to a ton of music. And hopefully  everything will be recovered enough so that I can hit the gym at night. But idk. I guess it’s back  and bi day. Legs Wednesday. Back and bi again Thursday or Friday. Anyways yeah. If the gym is  still closed I’ll just keep pushing everything a day back, it’s ﬁne and there’s nothing I can do abt it.  Oh man it’s so hot rn. Sleeping without the fan on and with the AC down…man this sucks.  However I am able to send and receive messages which is a plus and I couldn’t do that this  afternoon. So that’s nice. I’ve just been texting Alex tho bc I’m bitchless you know. It’s crazy and  so lame but I held out a slight bit of hope that Andrew would text today and just be like hey  everything okay w the storm and all that? But like nah whatever. I’m disregarding the fact that he  actually doesn’t give a shit abt me. But hey I gotta be delusional sometimes. I’m just a little lonely  still. And why is Jazhiel the one person who has asked me if I’m alive still                                      like damn it’s tough  out here. Full respect to him bc he’s a great guy it’s just that we aren’t close like that is that I  meant. But yep I have only talked to Alex and Jazhiel today. And ig Eric but I was just responding  to his texts. So perhaps when you think abt it I do have a lot of guy friends, relatively. As in as a  proportion of the total amount of friends I have. Not sure how that’s even happened. But yeah not  complaining bc they’re all great guys. And ik I was rambling on abt my feelings abt the whole  Andrew situation this morning. And since it’s nighttime I’m a little more pessimistic abt it all again. I  miss him but I also hate him. But I’m pessimistic in that I’m scared I won’t ﬁnd anyone who will  replace and mend that void that Andrew has left. And do what he couldn’t. What if I ﬁnd people  like Connor or Noah again, or god forbid, someone like Andrew? To be fair tho, I think if I make  sure to check that we are on the same page in terms of intentions on the ﬁrst date, it’ll be all chill.  But then ofc there’s the fear that I won’t ﬁnd anyone at all. Like what if I’ve lost my ability to pull.  Bc the only way I get involved w people romantically is when they make the ﬁrst move. I don’t  have it in me to make the ﬁrst move myself. Which as I mentioned before is half bc I actually don’t  ever just see someone attractive and think wow I need to be in a relationship w that person. And  half bc the person I’d get along best with is the type of person who would make the ﬁrst move. So  yeah I’m kinda just anxious, I guess. I hate the uncertainty of it all. Again I will say that I am  blessed with decent looks that allow me to kinda pull, but obviously that’s not guaranteed. Oh well.  I guess we’ll have to see. There’s not anything that I can do rn. We will simply have to wait. But I  must say, this summer has actually taken me out lmao. What a time. But again, great lessonswere learned. I’m just worried ya know. And it’s chill like if I never ﬁnd love, I’d gladly be a crazy cat lady who lives alone and has like 8 cats. But I do believe I’m ready for a romantic relationship and I do crave it. Especially after realizing how happy that thing w Andrew made me, even if we never actually were ofﬁcially dating. So yeah. I’m quite tired so I think I’ll go to bed. Get ready for a long ass day tmr. I’m tired but I don’t wanna go to bed which is annoying. It’s also hot as balls. And I miss Hannah and Austin. And I wanna go to the gym. I’m not upset rn, just kinda reminiscing I suppose. Last semester was so good man. Miss it so much. And I’m so sad that we’re already halfway through college. I’m not gonna go on abt that tho bc I’ll genuinely get upset. I should actually go to he’s bc my phone has gotten hot and I’m draining my battery plus I’m tired but uhhhh. Sigh. I don’t wannaaaaaaa."
29,2024-07-12,"Alright hello I have a pleasant happy journal session planned for today for a change. Right so  something clicked in my head this week and I’ve been so content and calm and also productive  ever since. Mainly it’s been work that’s been going well. I now totally understand what I’m doing  every day and I can whip up code real quick, at least compared to before. And I’ve had good  ideas too, and have the ability to implement them pretty quickly. It’s been good. I don’t feel all lost  and confused anymore. And I’ve been thinking quite clearly. I’m not sure what changed. But work  this week has been very good and had been the best week of work thus far. Tyler and I are faring  quite nicely. I don’t feel like he thinks I’m utterly stupid anymore. And mentally I’m doing well. I  know last week was rough w the whole Andrew thing but now I’m fairly sure I am over it for good.  Which is such a nice feeling, to have it all behind me. Funny enough it was him removing me as  an insta follower that helped me genuinely get going. I took him out my following too and deleted  links and photos from our messages. And removing the ability to stalk has been the greatest thing  I’ve done in the healing process. And then combine it with this silly but useful dream I had of him  last night - we were ﬂaming each other in LinkedIn DMs and he was a dick and he ended up  blocking me which really pissed me off bc I hate LinkedIn and he was being an actual asshole.  And yes I know this didn’t actually happen but in my mind it did and I hate him for it. Hahahaha.  But honestly the past couple days have been good. I think of him occasionally, but not in a longing  way. More like “damn I look so good rn, his loss, he fumbled.” And yeah like I guess it isn’t ideal  that he’s at the top of my mind but the fact that I think of him in this light is an improvement. Like  it’s focused more on myself and less on him. And casts him as the loser in the situation. Which he  is. Bc I have most my shit together. Not sure if I can say the same for him. But yeah, now I just  see it all as an experience that I 1) had fun during at the time, and 2) learned a lot from. And I  don’t think back on it bitterly, bc truly I did have a good time. And I really have learned a lot and  best believe I will be applying my new knowledge. So yep. It feels so nice that I’m at a good place  about the whole thing now. And I know that this time it is for real. Some days previously I’d be like  oh I’m over it and then start spiraling over it the next day. But now I feel quite certain that I’ve  achieved peace with it all. And I know that because I can think of him, but I’m not upset and don’t  hold any grudges anymore. Like I used to think of him if there was some trigger and then I’d get a  twinge of sadness. Now I don’t feel that. It’s more like oh yeah that happened lol. And I used to  get mad at him for treating me as he did. Somehow I’m not mad anymore. I think what should  come to people will come to them. If he treated me like a disposable option, he will see the same  thing happen to him someday. I am at peace w that. Karma will come. And I really have learned a  lot and had fun so perhaps I shouldn’t be too mad anyways. So yep. All that to say that  emotional/mentally this week has been good to me. Which is great. Okay I’m way tired and I keep  asleep who’s writing so I’m gonna go sleep. I keep typing in my sleep lmao but okay mighty ."
28,2024-07-15,"hey okay so! Things have been really good lately. in most/all aspects. and I’m kinda scared to…  feel happy abt it bc I don’t want it to all go to shit but I just wanted to journal a bit before I sleep. I  basically mentioned all this in my last entry but now I think I’m doing even better, somehow or  other. I’m doing great mentally. I’m absolutely certain I’m over Andrew now and it’s beautiful. I  don’t think of him much anymore. And when I do, it’s always a neutral perspective. not like oh god  that fucker or like oh man I miss him. it’s like oh yeah that guy. am I still mad and upset for what  he did? yeah sure but I’m over it and it doesn’t matter to me like that anymore. zero feelings for  him anymore. just glad I got to learn some important lessons. something just clicked somehow  and thank god it did, bc I was starting to feel like the healing process was gonna be forever. it’s  lowkey hilarious that my last straw was a dream I had abt him being a fucking dick. yeah it didn’t  happen, but he *would* do that, wouldn’t he? lmao. but yeah I’ve been done w it ever since. I keep  talking abt it bc I’m really glad it’s over now. and it’s such a nice change. from moping around to  being excited for a new start. I remember being really upset abt “starting over” w someone new -  like will I even ﬁnd anyone? can I pull at all? but now I’m excited for what the future brings in terms  of my love life. I think I have faith. and I know what not to do starting off. I am okay with being  independent, and I can obviously thrive in those circumstances. However I really would like to ﬁnd  someone who sees me as their number one and who I see the same way. In addition to me doing  well academically and career-wise and personally. I think I’m ready for it, personally. I have an  irrational (?) fear that I can’t pull people. which probs isn’t that rational bc I honestly keep glowing  up. gotta respect it. I have looked great this summer. and I think I look hot every time I wear a crop  top. and I pulled 4 people based on my appearance last year and I think I can hopefully keep that  up. this sounds so shallow but hey that’s how things start. And no I do not approach people. again  bc my ﬁrst thought when I see someone attractive is never that I want to start a relationship w  them. but yeah. I’m excited. and it is such a nice, fresh change. and I take it as a sign that I’m truly  over what happened w Andrew. I don’t even think I’m that bitter abt it anymore. bc it’s his loss,  really. I’d like to think I was in a better position in life overall than he was. I know what I’m looking  for in life and my education. he’d just transferred so I’ll give him some grace, but he hadn’t quite  had things put together yet. and I’d been willing to support him through that. and if he’s gonna  sabotage relationships like he did w me, then that’s your choice but it’s not gonna be good long  term. in the past I probably would’ve spiraled way more over this. I would’ve started questioning  my self worth, my looks, everything. but I think I know my worth now. or at least I know it better. I  still try to have a fairly modest overlook of myself, bc I don’t want to overestimate. but I think I’m a  great person. I’m fairly attractive, just by pure luck of genetics. I’m working on dressing a little  nicer too, which helps. I care deeply about my friends, even if that isn’t reciprocated. perhaps this  is also one of my larger ﬂaws. but my friends and family mean so much to me and I cherish them  so much. I try to show my appreciation through my actions, and I’m big on birthdays. I try my very  best to maintain connections, bc they mean so much to me. I’m also a very considerate person,  which ofc is linked to my anxiety and tendencies to people-please, but it’s still a good quality. I  want the people I care abt to be as comfortable as possible around me. and I want to prevent any  conﬂict. I’d also say that I’m a pretty cool person in terms of what I do academically and just out of  interest. I’m pretty proud of my music taste. I’d say it’s quite unique, compared to that of most  people I know. I guess I’m a bit of a metalhead, which people wouldn’t expect. I absolutely lovewaterparks and bad omens. and I’m a casual fan of some other metal bands plus nickelback. but I also love Dominic ﬁke and taylor swift. I play the saxophone - that’s pretty cool! I love sports and I am incredibly loyal to Tottenham despite the lack of tangible success. I think, though, my favorite trait about myself is my stubbornness. idk, maybe there’s a better word for it. but I mean it as in, if I have an aim and I set my mind to it, I will not give up on it bc I know that I can achieve it. if I have an idea for a personal project, I will dedicate hours upon hours to it bc I know I can do it. and then I do do it, and it’s so satisfying. same thing w internship applications. I can do whatever I want and I have full control of what I do, is how I sometimes like to think of it. and it’s a very satisfying realization. bc no matter how much I sometimes base my worth on other people, I am still in control of myself and what I do. so yep, that’s what I have to say about myself. I have a pretty positive outlook on it all. If you don’t like me or vibe w me that’s okay and I understand. if you had me and then threw me away, that is completely your loss. I hope that I can provide more to someone than just my looks and my affection (which I didn’t think were worth as much as maybe they are to some). I think half the reason why I’m now so content abt the whole Andrew thing is that I think I understand what happened, and the other half is that I realize it is his loss, not so much mine. bc ultimately I have been the bigger person. and yeah, you’ll hear me talk abt him less and less. which is lovely. Bc I’ve healed. and it’s delightful. I’ve been really happy these past days. today was a good day. I watched the euros and copa america ﬁnals. kinda sad that there won’t be footy anymore, but all good things must come to an end. and tbf neither competition was *that* good. only Spain and Germany were fun to watch in the euros. Maybe Georgia. copa America was bang average also. but the vibes were great. The Olympics start soon too, which I’m excited for. and then in mid August I get to go to Seattle!! I’m so excited for that, truly. sadly I don’t really get that much time to myself there (like outside the conference), but oh well. I should’ve stayed an extra day but ofc I wasn’t thinking abt that when I booked the tickets. still tho. Will be so much fun. I started talking to trus again. I missed the guy and it always kinda bothered me that we didn’t end our last convo on the best terms. so yeah we’ve been talking a ton and it feels like it’s back to normal. So yeah. just a nice little positive journal session. I am very tired so I will be sleeping soon. But yeah, life has been good. I feel pretty good abt myself. that’s abt it. and I hope that I can make this upcoming week a good one as well. cheers."
27,2024-07-17,"right so. I’m really really tired so I will be sleeping very soon but just wanted to quickly journal. a   short entry. things have been good! I’ve been in a really good mental state this week. I’ve been   cheerful - why shouldn’t I be? and honestly the lexapro works wonders. but yeah, had a nice   Sunday and watched the euros and copa ﬁnals. pretty much went as desired. and a gio assist!   been chatting w trus a lot and he’s great, I’ve missed him and our conversations. they’re always   way fun and also insightful. and I realized sometime today that I haven’t thought of Andrew in a   long time. not like days ofc bc I am in fact still kinda talking to trus abt it, but like defo I go hours   without even a thought of him. and it’s been like this the whole week really. and again like I   mentioned even if I do think of him it’s in a neutral way. tbf ig sometimes I still feel slightly angry   when I talk to ppl abt it again, but I never think of him in an I-miss-him way which is the key. and   also like I was saying, I’m genuinely excited for the future. both academically and personally. just   wanted to say tho, it is so so nice to realize you’re over something. like the realization hits that   holy shit I haven’t thought of it in so long…I’ve actually moved on. and you know for a fact you’ve   healed. it’s so nice. that spark of delight I felt when I made that realization today was so amazing.   a drug fr. overall life is just good. everything feels positive. and I’m also having fun w tayLyrics.   things started working out. so I should be genuinely done w it soon ish. just some small things left   and like one bigger thing. so that’s been a fun side thing I mess around w for fun. ok I’m so tired   I’m gonna go sleep now. hoping tmr is good! cheers and goodnight!"
26,2024-07-28,"We fuckin lost power again I’m dead                 it’s not raining or windy or anything so genuinely no clue  how this has happened. but I mean. It’s whatever. I have lots of battery and I wanna occupy  myself so here I am. These days I’ve been working really hard on tayLyrics, one of my favorite  personal projects. My ambition is to promote it to the fan base after I’m done. Mainly on Twitter, bc  I think the whole fandom culture there could make this thing spread like wildﬁre. It’s been going  really well, bc I converted the app from R Shiny to Streamlit and it looks nice. I’m trying to ﬁx the  lack of mobile user friendliness, but otherwise we are all good. And I’m super excited, bc Jiant is  excited abt it too. He is gonna help me ﬁle a copyright for it before I start promoting. And even if  this app doesn’t go big, hey it’s just a $35 application fee, plus me and Hannah get this wonderful  game to play. I had some brilliant ideas lately and my best one was to add a leaderboard to the  app, to really up the stakes a bit. Right now I am dominating the leaderboard ofc. W my negative  scores. But I wrote a leaderboards class that manages a SQLite database. What’s great abt it is  that it can be reused for any artist really. Anyways yep I’m really excited abt the whole thing. And  I’m glad I’m approaching the end of it bc I’m lowkey tired of this project and wanna move onto the  next. Or at least the next phase of it. But yeah that’s goin well!!     Let’s see. What else do I wanna talk abt. I’m on my period. Which has been a little tough on me  mentally, but not that bad at all. It’s just that I had a dream or two where everyone hated me and I  was an outsider. And I had very ﬂeeting thoughts of how I missed (“missed”) Andrew. very very  ﬂeeting thoughts tho, bc I don’t miss him and I also haven’t thought of him in a long time. Which is  so nice btw. I was talking to trus abt this tho - how I’m a hate-fueled person kinda. A big part of  why I push myself so much is bc I wanna be better than other people, most especially the people I  don’t like or the people who have scorned or wronged me. I wanna know that I am in a better  place in life than they are. Which is probably silly bc I should do things for myself (which I do), but  hey, whatever works. And I know that I am in a better place than most if not all the people I have  in mind. Granted I was already doing way better than Andrew in all aspects when we were a thing.  And now I am even higher up, I’d say. Ofc idk what he’s doing and I really don’t care, but I doubt  he’s gotten any further in life than he was when we met. But yeah. I guess this outlook in life is  probably bc I’ve always compared myself to others. And I hate that feeling of knowing you are  inferior to others. So my solution is just to push myself real hard and make sure I am above them.  And yeah I realize that probs isn’t the healthiest perspective, but tbf this is just a partial motivator  for me. Mainly I really do do things for myself. For my own entertainment, or just to better my  skills. But it’s just nice to know that the expectations I hate for myself, and my own love for nerdy  things, have set me in a position where I am better than the people who in my mind don’t deserve  success. I’m a bitter person. I hold long grudges. If you fuck w me, I won’t forget it. I enjoy being a  dickhead, at least in my mind, to people who were dickheads to me. But yeah this was a long  tangent. Ig I was talking abt Andrew. Uh well. I haven’t thought abt him in forever. And I’m not  really that emotionally attached to the situation anymore. It’s like an “oh yeah that happened” sort  of feeling when I think of him. I’m mad at him ofc. But the main feelings I’ve been experiencing  whilst on my period are just feelings of longingness?                  Like i really just miss having someone whowas my number one, and who also saw me as their number one. That’s all. Bc as I’ve said tons of times before, it sucks to know that you’re not ﬁrst choice in anyone’s life. And it sucks to have thought I had that and would have that for a long time, just to not have it anymore and to also ﬁnd out that I never did. But it’s kinda nice tho, bc I have someone to hate massively on every day if I feel like it. Like oh I hope he’s having a terrible day today. I do wonder how he’s doing. I don’t care, but I am but a curious person and can’t help myself. Anyways. Anytime I’m mad at anything I can just direct my hate towards him. He is now my scapegoat. Except I rlly don’t think of him anymore so ig he isn’t even a scapegoat. Idk what I’m saying anymore I’m really tired. Point is tho that I hope better things are to come for me personally academically and career wise. And I hope bad things are to come to the people who genuinely wronged me. That’s the TLDR of today’s session. Aight I’m gonna sleep. Night!"
25,2024-08-22,"Life has been really good. I mean. It’s been stressful af since we’ve just moved into our apartment  and school is starting so soon but really idk if I’ve ever been better. I’m so happy to be w Hannah  again. I adore her. And I’d do anything for her. But yep we moved into our 14th ﬂoor apartment  and it’s really much nicer than I ever expected. We’ve got our full sized beds w a ton of windows  that give us so much natural light. The fridge is real big and is ﬁlled with food to last us a month.  We’ve got a tiny lil balcony. Got a shelf and then a shoe rack / coat hanger. Our TV is decently  sized and the kitchen is honestly way nice. The bathroom is way larger than I expected. A ton of  positives and we are essentially unpacked and done decorating. School starts next Monday and I  can’t say I’m super thrilled. But I am happy to be back in Austin again. And Hannah’s friend group  has been so nice when it comes to including me in everything. I even got to go to Kenadi’s  birthday dinner, which was so nice. We’ve gone to Kenadi and Lauren’s place a couple times for  card games, and went to Sydney’s yesterday night. It’s been so nice and I love them all. I wouldn’t  consider myself as being in the friend group, and I am okay w that. Went to Kenadi and Lauren’s  tonight for board games. We played code names, taboo, and then this murder game where you  need to try and kill this dude in a mansion. I won that game!!!! As we were leaving tho lauren  pointed to a photo on the fridge of her, Hannah, Kenadi and Lauren and was like we gotta put a  sticker of Jasmine up there and honestly it warmed my heart bc truly I can’t tell what they think of  me. I don’t wanna be invited to everything just out of pity or just bc Hannah and I are so close. I  hope they truly do enjoy my presence tho. Anyways. I am super tired so this is as far as I’m gonna  get. Night!"
24,2024-08-27,"So today was our ﬁrst day of classes. Well yesterday I guess. Doesn’t matter. And I didn’t even  have any classes. I had one scheduled but I’m gonna drop it for my linguistics research course w  Jessy. Which idk if there is even a set time for it. But yep. I have all of my remaining classes tmr.  And it’s so annoying to have those 4 back to back to back to back classes bc where tf do I eat  man. And I don’t wanna bring something bc eating in class makes me uncomfy. So for tmr I might  just pack some snacks in ziplock baggies but it sucks that I don’t have proper snacks. Like I don’t  have the protein chips or anything. Just uhhh Doritos. But in all fairness my classes end at 3.30 so  that’s not an absolutely horriﬁc time to eat. Could be worse. Anyways. It’s nice to be at school and  to feel super hectic again. I’m still not totally used to it ofc but I’m getting there. I’m excited to learn  new things, work on new projects, and meet new people. But also I do dread seeing some of the  ppl I hate in my major. I’m a hater and I can’t help myself. Like I actively wish bad things on them  and I’m sorry. Oh and also. I ﬁnally went to Greg again today and it felt so nice to be back. I hit  back and bi alone which was kinda bad bc I’d hyped the whole thing up sm but then didn’t have a  great workout. It’s tough having to adjust back again. and I did double the usual amount of bicep  curls. Oh, and I saw Andrew. It was kinda funny. I assume he saw me too. But thank god we didn’t  make eye contact. It was in the free weight room and we were back to back but obviously we can  see each other perfectly in the mirrors. He’s way too identiﬁable. Unlucky for him I actually looked  hot as balls today. I feel the incredible need to make him feel regret and like he made a mistake. I  won’t ever know how he feels bc ofc I’m not gonna ask, and honestly I don’t care that much, I just  want him to suffer for being a dick. But yeah. I looked amazing in that Greg lighting. I didn’t rlly  watch him or anything, I just saw the hat and the rosy cheeks and the overall body posture and  mannerisms and was like yeah that’s him alright. I have zero doubt ofc. It just itches me a little tho  - like what is he thinking? Does he ever regret it? I imagine not rlly at all. But I wanna know. Do I  regret getting w him? Not at all, bc it was a learning experience from beginning to end. And  honestly it ironically inﬂated my ego a ton during the summer after we’d ended things, bc I realized  I was in a much better position academically and career wise than he was.                                        And I know - not think  - I deserve better. Naturally, the week we’d ended things, choose any day and ask if I’d agree to  patch things up if he asked and I’d say yes. But now it’s a resounding no. I’d laugh in bro’s face  and be like yeah that seems like a you problem. And I yearn to actually do that but I doubt I’ll get  to. But yeah. Sorry to bring this all up again. And I know for a fact that I am over the whole  situation. But seeing him again honestly really dampened my mood. Bc it makes me realize again  that damn, sucky people exist. And I guess I am ofc still upset that we’d ended like we did, but  what can I do abt that really? Anyways. It’s ﬁne and it’s chill. It’s gonna be way awkward seeing  him all the time at Greg. will be totally ﬁne if I’m in a group again but while I go alone, it’s just  weird bc I’m scared we’ll make eye contact. Like tf do I do. I’d like to think I’d smile and wave. And  then move on w my life. I just dk tho. Writing abt it helps appease my anxieties abt it for sure. So  tired so I am leaving now goodnight !"
23,2024-09-15,"Right so. Kinda…lowkey…going through it lmao. In a minor way. Perhaps this is extremely  shallow, but god I’m so bored with my romantic life and I need to get a someone asap. Which it  sucks that I am aware of this, bc now that I want it, it won’t come to me. It always comes when I  least expect it. Bc hannah now has this thing w Anthony (long story, I won’t elaborate), it’s making  me look and feel hella lonely. And these past couple days, to my horror, I’ve unfortunately started  to miss Andrew. Or perhaps what I really miss is the feeling of being liked romantically and having  a romantic life. You know? It’s just sad to think abt what could’ve been. He was my type on paper,  you know? Tall strong blonde attractive dude w beautiful blue eyes, played football, hit the gym,  had a life, was (as far as I could tell) smart, had a personality, and had good music taste. Like  damn. I felt so lucky at the time, like how’d I pull that? And don’t worry, it’s not like I miss him  desperately. It’s more of a longing feeling, like damn, we were so good for a bit. Obviously I have  so much more life ahead of me to ﬁnd a romantic partner, and I wouldn’t say I’m too concerned  about not ﬁnding anyone ever, but like what if?? And what even are the chances that someone I  meet meshes well w me and is my “type”? Love is so weird man. With all the things that simply  need to go right by luck, it’s crazy that people are even able to ﬁnd someone they can consider  their soulmate. I’m just kinda upset abt it all over again bc I unfortunately miss the guy I thought  he was. And I miss the physical affection a lot. I miss just having someone to text throughout the  day to update them abt random things. It’s so stupid. Half of me misses all the little things that  come w any romantic relationship, and half of me actually genuinely misses HIM. Which is terrible  and tragic. Bc bro was a dickhead. At the end, at least. But before that he truly had been such a  great guy. A sweetie really. And it hurts bc I don’t doubt that he was genuinely interested at ﬁrst,  but to see his love slip away was painful af. Which is so silly bc we never dated ofﬁcially but still.  You can’t give me all that beautiful stuff and then take it away when I hadn’t done anything wrong.  It’s whatever tho. I’m just kinda scared and lonely bc I just want someone I can call my number  one and that they can call their number one, yk? I think it all has kinda gotten to my head recently  bc of Hannah’s thing w Anthony - I kinda doubt it’s a long-term thing (she herself told me that, I’m  not a dick), but it still kinda makes me feel lonelier bc 1) I don’t have someone like that and 2) I’m  basically a third wheel in our own apartment. I do think I’m ready for a romantic relationship, it’s  just that I honestly don’t put myself out there enough to have many opportunities for connecting w  potential romantic interests. I just wanna be w someone romantically rn like genuinely. And I  wouldn’t even mind if it were a ﬂing, as long as that is made aware to me from the start. Bc I just  wanna…yk, cuddle up w someone and hold hands and kiss and hug a little. You understand. And  I’m just kinda lost bc how do I even ﬁnd a romantic interest?? The past couple semesters I had  luck w that bc ppl asked for my number. 4 diff ones, which was nice. But like lowkey how’d I even  manage that. Idk man. And bc I’m so confused as to how to ﬁnd someone else, it makes my past  shortcomings hurt more. If Andrew hadn’t been a proper dick, we rlly could’ve worked out great.  Bc we did bond quite well. I actually nearly lost my head earlier today. I thought abt sending him a  happy birthday message come the 25th. But I have elected against that. I never deleted his  number, which tbh I can’t even explain why. Maybe I’m holding out hope he’ll text me again  someday apologizing for his actions and asking me to take him back. Lmao. Anyways. If he  asked, lowkey I’d be tempted but ultimately I’m fairly sure I’d tell him in a somewhat polite way to  fuck off and that he’s lost his chance. This summer was transformative to me. After we endedthings, I did come to the very strong realization that I deserved better than him. And I do. I deserve someone who loves me and is committed to our relationship. Who is serious abt his career and academics. It’s whatever tho. I’ll get there’s someday innit. I’m too tired to keep writing but yeah. That summarizes how I’ve felt these past few days. Imma sleep now so night!"
22,2024-09-16,"Alright. In kind of a shitty mood. This semester honestly rlly sucks. I don’t enjoy my classes and  research is kinda going south. I’ve resorted to studying the rate of group vs individual referring  expressions in individualist vs collectivist countries, which is interesting but I’m just so scared I’m  gonna fail. And like when have I ever failed when I put my whole heart and soul into a grand  undertaking? Very very rarely if ever at all. But I’m still scared. Anyways tho. I’m also just not  having a great time when it comes to my social life. Feel like I’m back to doing so many things  alone now. A lame friendless bum. I go to the gym alone and it’s scary sometimes. Idk what  Lauren and Kenadi do in the evenings but I miss them. Hannah hasn’t had the motivation to go to  the gym as of late so it’s just been me sadly. Which is ﬁne and I’m used to it tbf. And it also means  I get to do whatever the fuck I want which I do enjoy. I’ve been doing back and bi twice a week,  and I do both the machine bicep curls and the bench ones each of those days. It’s also sad tho bc  all of our old NPCs at Greg aren’t there anymore. Maybe a couple are still around but most aren’t  anymore. I do see Alex most days which is nice tho. I used to see Andrew like every time but he  wasn’t there a single time last week and I went 4 times. Which is kinda crazy. And I hate to  speculate but I don’t wonder where bro went. Most likely scenario he just found a diff gym. Or he  could’ve died. But it’s kinda nice to see him lowkey. Just a familiar face yk? Even if things ended  poorly it’s chill to me and I’ve gotten over it and at this time I don’t feel a ton of bad blood. And I  still wanna talk. Maybe we should’ve stayed friends bc I think at this point I just wanna talk to more  ppl at the gym. But I will say tho, maybe I’ve gotten more approachable or something bc lately I  don’t go a single gym session without talking to a couple new people. It’s obviously usually just  them asking me how many sets I’ve got left or vice versa, but hey, that’s something. Bc I didn’t  used to get asked that often at all. So I’ll take that. Anyways. I feel like my life rn is so boring and I  really need something to spice it up a lil. I need my romantic life to stand up and start performing  bc I’m over this silly single life. But it rlly is just my fault I don’t have a romantic partner tho bc I rlly  don’t put myself out there a ton. In addition to the fact that I overall just don’t talk much. So yeah.  But I’ve been mulling over it a lot lately. Love is such a crazy thing. I feel like it takes so much to  ﬁnd your person. Generally luck tho. Kinda like how I found hannah. And I feel so shallow to have  a “type” but it is true that I most likely will ﬁnd someone that is my type at the gym. So I suppose I  should start exploring new gym times lmao. I’m jk I won’t end up doing that. Never worth  sacriﬁcing my own gym schedule. I’m very stubborn abt going to the gym btwn 8pm to like  10.30pm ish. Never during the day bc that’s ass. And going back to the type thing, I feel like it’s  not right to have “expectations” of my romantic partner. Like I don’t wanna be disappointed if the  next person I talk to romantically doesn’t ﬁt the characteristics of my type. It’s all just a mess and it  pisses me off too. But whatever. I’m tired so I’m gonna sleep. Probs a long ass day tmr. So yeah.  Night."
21,2024-09-17,"I’m tired man. I’ve been stressed lately which is why I’m trying to get back into journaling. I think it   helps. I am taking my lexapro but somehow these last days have been extra stressful and I don’t   appreciate that. I guess the work just really piles up. And everyone is annoying me. Not their fault,   I’m just extra sensitive as of late. I suppose my period is probably soon. I feel so lame and lonely   going about my day alone but at the same time I also get too overwhelmed doing things for too   long w multiple people. One of my main sources of excitement these days has been the gym   (prime bitchlessness, I know). But it has been fun. Ok nvm I was gonna write more but I keep   falling asleep so gnn."
20,2024-09-18,"Ok so I lowkey had such a shit ass day. But the good thing abt that is that it won’t be at all hard for  tmr to be better. I do appreciate that fact. I don’t particularly wanna talk abt my day tho bc I feel  like that always makes me feel worse. So for now I’m just listening bad omens while journaling  and I feel calm. Highlight of the day tho - I ﬁnally found my bad omens prints and got to put them  up on my wall. I added a picture of the new wall to this entry!! The two pictures of Noah  individually are sooooo good man. I also saw this guy at the gym yday (and several times  previously at the gym) that looks like Noah lowkey. He’s pretty. But I need to get out of my boy  obsessed era asap bc that is so embarrassing man. Like come on. But I have been looking  incredible some days this semester and so maybe I should take advantage of that whilst I am boy  obsessed? I don’t fuckin know man. Approaching ppl confuses me sm. Bc how do you know who  to approach vs who not to? Like obviously you don’t approach every person you ﬁnd attractive  right? So where’s that boundary? That’s why I don’t rlly think I’ll ever approach someone? The  only ever time I was close to approaching someone was when Jude and he’d been the one to  come up to me. Which btw I stand by the fact that he is one of the most attractive guys I’ve had  the privilege of meeting. His brother is gorgeous too. Hella genes. But yeah. I’m rlly not one to  have crushes. And I’d really rather be approached in the ﬁrst place anyways. But I’m more of the  type where I’d say yes to so many people if they asked me, but if I had to go up and ask them  myself I wouldn’t do it 95% of the time. I also rlly don’t put myself out there a lot - as you know I  am far from a social butterﬂy and hence I rlly don’t have much opportunity to just…talk to ppl and  bond w them. Which is where most romantic relationships start. Not from zero to a hundred;  usually it’s like 15 to a hundred or something. So yeah idk. I need to get out of my boy crazy era  so I can lock in on other things bc I am painfully aware of the fact that I will probably not be ﬁnding  a long term partner in college and that’s ﬁne. But like I just can’t help but really wanna…kiss  someone, yk? Like damn I’d take anything fr. I wouldn’t mind a lil ﬂing rn. And this should warrant  me a few slaps in the face but damn kissing Andrew was fun. And the cuddles were great bc he  was so strong. But obviously that won’t happen again bc he’s a proper dick. It’s just upsetting man  bc for a month I had everything. But I won’t get back into that. Point is, I wanna kiss someone.  Well I actually would like very much to make out w someone and put my hands on his face. Jesus  Christ I need to be sedated. This is terrible. I’m not even down bad for anyone in particular, I’m  just…down bad. For opposite sex physical affection, I suppose. That’s so embarrassing man. But  whatever. Whatever! Idk how to even get out of this slump. Like obviously I work all day on school  stuff so it’s not like my mind isn’t occupied w other stuff. And I am perfectly aware that I am verycapable on my own. In fact, I can thrive on my own and I’m very much conﬁdent in my own abilities. Perhaps it’s the uncertainty of it all that troubles me as much as it does. I am used to having a goal, and then setting my mind to it and achieving it in whatever means I can. Things like romantic relationships just…come. No warning. And I really don’t have control over it until after it starts. Which is obviously the key part but I just want it to start. I just need someone to slap me uptop the head so I can stop thinking abt men. Bc that’s so stupid. But damn bro. I could rlly use kisses and cuddles rn. You understand. And I can bet that the more I talk abt  it, the less likely it is to occur. No wayd of measuring that but trust me on it. Half of me doesn’t even rlly know what I’m looking for. But man I just wanna kiss and hug someone. Ok I’m so so tired rn so I will be knocking myself out so gn."
19,2024-09-19,Hello lad. I am so tied so this entry is fonnssumlr
18,2024-09-20,So yesterday’s journal entry was a massive failure lmao. I checked it this morning bc I remember  not ﬁnishing it but man I laughed so hard at it. I’m already doing better than yesterday journalling-  wise. Today was kinda shitty but that’s fairs Thursdays are never really great. And I don’t wanna  talk abt it. I’ve been so annoyed with everyone and everything today and it makes me feel and  seem like a massive dickhead but I can’t help myself man. everyone is annoying the shit out of  me. It’s obnoxious. Anyways I’m actually really sleepy rn so I’m gonna sleep. Did better than yday  at least.
17,2024-09-21,"Today was soooo bad man. I don’t rlly wanna talk abt it. I annoy myself sm bc I feel like I never  talk abt what has happened and why I feel shitty. And I imagine it would help bc I’d try to reason  my feelings out a little. But I just always avoid talking abt things that made me unhappy. I know  things have been going poorly bc of my thoughts abt getting back w Andrew. I suppose it isn’t  even rlly fully my choice bc he’d have to want to rekindle too. But over the summer I had rlly  established and ground into my head that I deﬁnitively deserved better than him. I was successful,  happy, and just overall life was treating me well. But now everything is genuinely shit and my ego  has been busted and so I’m like yeah maybe we are on the same level. But really my deal is that I  reallyyyyy wanna be w someone. Even if it’s just a ﬂing. I want to kiss someone pretty. And like I  gotta give it to the man but Andrew is quite pretty lmao. The blonde jacked stuff does appeal to  me. Very much. Lmao. And like truly idk how to ﬁnd anyone else who can compare to how cool I  thought he was at ﬁrst, yk? I might go on a (casual) date with this guy called Calvin I met at the  gym on Thursday. He is kinda the opposite of my type on paper tho which is why I’m a bit wary of  the fact that it might be hard for us to connect. But obviously I won’t just turn someone down bc  they aren’t my “type.” Bc that’s crazy shallow. So yeah I’ll give it a try. And he seems cool and he’s  fun. So yeah that’s where I’m at. But I’m really confused abt what I should do abt this Andrew  thing. I doubt he ever thinks of me but I am thinking of him today. I might genuinely send him a  happy birthday message come the 25th. I’m very meticulous abt birthdays and it leaves a bad  taste in my mouth if I don’t wish someone a happy birthday when ik it is their birthday. And also I  don’t rlly like how things ended btwn us and I wish it were more amicable. I also thought it’d be  funny to automate happy birthday messages so I set something up in the shortcuts app but idk if it  works. So I also wanna try that out lmao. So he’s my guinea pig. I don’t expect much of it, and  hell, maybe he even has me blocked, but it’s rlly not a big deal. I just have the intense urge to do  this and I won’t rest if I don’t do it so like fuck it. This past week has been so shitty tho. Like  everything has gone poorly or at best very mid. I need some good things to happen so I can get  out of this annoying slump. The fact that the gym has been the highlight of my day every day I’ve  gone is just lame as hell. Which btw I’ve been doing back and bi on Mondays and Thursdays, and  leg day on Wednesdays. And because of how much of a hard time I’ve been having recently, and  bc gym has become a highlight, I went on Friday last week and this week as a “fuck around day.”  It kinda serves as a mini push day, but I also do bicep curls and like some other random stuff. But  it does absolutely help my mental state, which is nice. But I do the chest ﬂy and shoulder press as  my push day components. The rest is free roaming really. But yeah, thank god for the gym. The  people watching is always fun. And I like feeling all sore and tired after a workout. But anyways.  Let me talk abt another highlight of my week. Every week rlly ig. But I’ve been getting even more  into Bad Omens these past couple weeks. As if I wasn’t already obsessed w them. But I’ve gotten  into their other albums and I listen to them a shit ton every day. I ﬁnished on 1.6k minutes of bad  omens last week. This week will be similar, maybe a splash less. But I love them so much man.  Phenomenal music. I can’t wait for whatever work they put out next. Okay I’m gonna go ahead  and end the entry here bc I’m tired and my head hurts so night."
16,2024-09-22,"Hello lads. Decent day today - I went to our game vs ULM alone and it was honestly really nice. I  got a good view and was in control of everything which felt good. I am in bed now listening to bad  omens whilst writing this. I’m sore from my mini push day session on Friday. I think it’s from the  chest ﬂy. Anyways. I guess I can run through my day a little since it wasn’t bad. Hannah and I  went to Costco around noon and got some bulk necessities. She went out w her parents and  Sean a bit after we got home. I made mac and cheese w a hot dog and it was so good. Probs  same thing tmr. Around 4.30ish I went out to the stadium and engaged in some of their pre game  festivities - I got a free monster that I hydrated myself with and nothing else. Oh and on the way  there I stopped at the target to get a new pair of sunglasses. Then I went back to the apartment  and lay down for a bit, switched to my clear bag, and left again. I got to the stadium at maybe  6.20; getting in was quite a hassle since it was so close to kickoff. It was chill tho. I found a spot  higher up at the end of row 69. It’s actually really nice up there bc there are less people and I end  up w more space. And I like the spots on the end bc I don’t have to worry abt heads blocking me.  We were pretty good. A few mishaps but it’s chill. 2 INTs, but it’s ﬁne and we won by a large  margin regardless. Andddd OU lost. Number one in the nation baby. I left halfway through the  third quarter after a quiet several minutes where ULM had a couple rlly long possessions. And off  after that we started scoring like crazy. I left when we had maybe 32 points and we ended on 51.  But I got back and ate chicken nuggets. I literally had 14 with ranch and after that I was still  hungry. I’m telling you these days I’ve been ravenous. It’s crazy fr. But yeah that was my day. A  very boring rundown but this is a journal and I do not care abt being entertaining. Tmr will  hopefully be a decent day too. I’m stressed abt this date I agreed to go to a this guy Calvin that I  met at the gym on Thursday. Fact is, he’s far from my type on paper. Which obviously I won’t write  ppl off just bc they’re not my type, but he’s also a fairly signiﬁcant amount older and we study the  same thing. Which kinda…isn’t the most appealing to me. Like it’s cool we’ll be able to nerd out  together I suppose, but I’ve always been under the impression that I’d prefer for my romantic  partner to study something different from what I study. And another brutal fact is that I am simply  not attracted to the man. Which I’m so sorry to say, but also there is nothing I can do about that, is  there. I can’t just…force myself to like someone else’s appearance. And lowkey it was the same  situation w Jazhiel. I’m just worried abt how to…yk…break the news, I suppose. My expectations  are that I just won’t vibe a ton and I’ll have to just let that be known. But I hate doing that bc  obviously it’s lame if he pays for the date and then gets turned down. So hopefully uhhhh he  doesn’t vibe a ton w me either. I think it’ll be cool to socialize I guess. Learn some stuff from a guy  who is further along in the data science pathway maybe. Idfk. I’m also still stuck on Andrew, I can’t  even lie. It’s annoying, bc I’d been over him for months and now I’m like yeah I wanna kiss bro.  And I miss him. It’s not even just the idea of him that I miss. I miss him. And I think there’s not  much that can stop me from texting him happy birthday come Wednesday. And I’m sorry abt it but  I just cannot help myself. And I might just fully embrace it - be like happy birthday! I know we  aren’t quite on speaking terms but I hope you have a good one! You know? And I really don’t care  enough abt the consequences. I suppose the best case scenario is him being like damn I miss  you and I fumbled and can we rekindle. I’d obviously have to consider it but most likely I’d be like  yeah why not. He could also air me. Which I’d be chill w. Leave me on read or whatever. Or he  could be like who is this if he’d deleted my number. So many possibilities. But that’s the fun of lifeinnit. There are inﬁnite possible possibilities. And I won’t know till I fuck around and try. What do I want out of it? Well I would kinda like to rekindle so I can get my kisses and cuddles. Long term I don’t know that I see myself w him bc he clearly had commitment issues. But if it’s a ﬂing I’d lowkey take it. Or if he’s changed his mind and wants to try for something long term I’m willing to give it another go too. But idk why I’m thinking all these scenarios up when the most likely one is that nothing will come of it. Which is chill. And I should get over it. Well I am over it and have been for a long time. I’m just bored. Sorry. Until someone else comes along that can match the enjoyment he gave me when we were talking, I will be bored. I really gotta put myself out there more. Bc so far the only ppl I’ve talked to who’ve had romantic intentions are ppl who I didn’t know previously. Like they came up to me and asked for my contact info and stuff. Jazhiel was a tad diff bc we were in class together, but I also never knew he existed before so idk. Anyways. I appreciate that people think I am attractive enough to approach me. It actually does great things for my ego. But I am slacking on putting myself in situations where ppl can learn more abt me as a whole. I am in one org. Granted I happen to be the president of that org but still. I will say tho that this sem I’ve met a lot more ppl. So maybe I am putting myself out there. I met this guy Ian who interviewed to be an MLDS ofﬁcer and we nearly accepted him. I liked his one story (it had a cat in it so ofc I had to) and he DMed me to ask for an MLDS tshirt and we DMed back and forth for a little. He also added me to his close friends story for some reason? Idk. He’s so real tho bc I will also talk to someone for a day and then add them to my spam. I saw this guy at one of the ESL presidents meetings and good god he was beautiful. I connected w him on LinkedIn lmao and followed him on insta. He def thinks I’m a weirdo but it’s whatever. He’s president of Texas aerial robotics which is such a sick club honestly. Speaking of, I wonder when our next presidents meeting is bc those are honestly quite fun. Makes me feel so important. Ok I just checked and it is on the 30th. Next Monday at 5pm. How exciting. It is annoying that Wendy is a useless co president tho. i am basically the full president. She is very very useless. Respectfully! It’s whatever tho. She does do whatever I tell her to do which is nice. And she is very kind. So whatever. Rather her than vidhi ofc. Fuck vidhi. Ok what else  have I to talk abt. Idk. Don’t think there’s anything else so I’m gonna conclude this entry here. Night."
15,2024-09-23,"Journal timeeee lads. I’m gonna try to get into the habit of journaling again bc it helps me feel less  alone. But I went on that date w Calvin today. It went about exactly how I expected it. He’s chill  and cool and we had a pretty good chat but I’m just not attracted to him, and now that I know him  better I’ve realized also that we just don’t have much in common. And that’s usually ﬁne, like I  can’t always have things in common w ppl, but like we genuinely are too different. He smokes a  lot of weed, drinks a lot (he legit brought a whole ass bottle of alcohol for us                       ), doesn’t like  sports, has honestly a kinda shit music taste…not sure I’m a fan. I think we’ll just have to kinda  end it amicably. He’s smart and he’ll understand. If he were a tall blonde guy would things be  different?? Uhhh. Lowkey honestly no. I think that’s a good question for me to ask. Am I put off  just by looks? No, that’s not the whole story. So yeah. I also just read through the few journal  entries from when Andrew and I had just met. Man I was down horrendous lmao. Rightfully so,  tho. And when we’d starting things off, I will say that he truly did everything right. I really  appreciate that our ﬁrst hangout wasn’t an ofﬁcial date and was just a casual hangout. Dates  make me nervous even if I’m not the one who is trying to impress the other. I do miss him. I can’t  lie. I miss him. Goddamn it. I don’t think there is anything that can hold me back from texting him  happy birthday on Wednesday anymore. I will be doing it. I don’t think I expect much to come of it.  I just want us to be on more of talking terms. Amicable terms. I do miss him. And like sure, he  could be dating someone else rn. I don’t rlly care. I just wanna wish the man a happy birthday bc  I’ll be miserable if I don’t. And if we can get back to chatting a little, even better. Maybe he has me  blocked or has my number deleted - it’s ﬁne, it’s chill. Again, I will keep my expectations low. It’s  just tough rn bc now I’m gonna be comparing every potential relationship to how we were in the  beginning. And how he made me feel. He was truly perfect for some time. And I loved how  obsessed he was with me. I remember talking to Alex abt the whole situation after we ended  things, and for some time we were like yeah he wasn’t interested long term from the beginning,  but then we went through the old texts and Alex was like wait yeah he was def interested. And I  never will know what ended up causing him to dip, and I really would like to know. Even tho I’ve  been content w it for months now. And I have had a theory for so long abt what happened. But like  I wanna hear the real story. Anyways I gotta stop. Worst thing that happens after I wish him a  happy birthday is that he blocks me from that and or tells me to never message again. Like damn I  don’t think we’re on such bad terms. But yeah I’m keeping that in mind tho. I think I’m just spiraling  a bit bc I’ve got nothing rlly going for me rn. And I just want something that I can have that makes  me happy. I’m also bored so I want some action. And I want to kiss someone SO bad it is terrible.  I wanna make out w someone man. Someone I’m genuinely attracted to. Tough out here. And it’ll  also be so fun if hannah and I are in “relationships” at the same time. I wouldn’t say she and  Anthony are super serious rn but it also doesn’t seem much like it’ll be a short term thing. They’re  def not ofﬁcial. Idk if they’ve been on proper dates yet? But anyways. He’s chill. Sometimes I get  annoyed w how loud they get but it’s whatever bc I end up just putting my AirPods in and listening  to Noah yell in my ear. I love love love bad omens. They posted a reel video thing today that said  something like “it ends now” or whatever. So new eraaaaaaa. I’m so hype man. I will so be going  to their shows. If they have one in Houston and in Austin best believe I will be pulling up to both.  It’s so sad tho bc they’d obviously be playing new songs and less older ones so idk if I’d even getto hear like a villain. Anyways. That’s wayyyyy in the future. Back in the grindset tmr. School study work during the day and back and bi at night. Fun. Lowkey I might genuinely start hitting the gym 4 times a week. Friday being a fuck around day. Mini push day. Being at the gym genuinely helps me relax a lot if I’ve had a shit ass day. The people watching is fun. And like it’s helping my social skills a ton. Today w Calvin, I wasn’t stressed at all truly - bc I was being really sociable and things ﬂowed naturally. I didn’t have to worry abt being awkward and lame and boring. And making small talk at the gym generally comes quite naturally. I’m so proud that I’ve reached that stage. Socializing isn’t my strong suit but I can do it well without stressing too much over it. It’s beautiful stuff. (I just transitioned from Even to Artiﬁcial Suicide and damn that’s crazy). Like I don’t have to rely on the other party to carry the convo??? Wowwww. But if it’s not one on one it’s diff. I will not be talking if it’s not one on one lmao. Anyways. Sighhh. This semester has been pretty damn ass. I will say tho that the apartment life and the gym routine have been great for me. The only highlights. I’m really enjoying my gym nights. It is crazy that I spend like 6 hours a week at the gym. But it is such valuable use of my time really. Okay I should shut up bc damn I am ramblinggggg. And my music just ended haha."
14,2024-09-24,"Journal timeeeeee folks. Today was decent! I was actually pretty productive. Did a lot of my  research stuff. Did not do any actual work for my classes tho so tmr is gonna kick my ass  probably. There’s so much shit I have to do for CS309 and it’s generally ﬁne it’s not hard but it’s  just so time consuming man. It’s lame. But whatever. Elements of networking can kiss my ass, I  don’t mind dropping a C in this class honestly bc I’m not risking my sanity for a decent grade. That  class is so ass. Genuinely legitimately makes me want to kill myself. Prof Han is not good. She  seems like a sweetie unlike Carol who seemed like a bitch all around, but they both suck ass at  teaching. Carol obviously is the very end of the spectrum tho so really anyone is better than her.  Never forgetting her. But yeah today was decent. I felt glad w the amount of work I got done. I  promoted waterparksGuessr for the second time and it got a fairly decent reception again! There  are acc so many ppl on the leaderboard now. And I really love parxies. They’re actually welcoming  and down to earth unlike swifties. Swifties are so pretentious man. But yeah I’m glad I chose the  right fandom to hang around in. I think I enjoy being around the few bad omens fans I’ve found  too. A couple ppl acc played the bad omens game! Beat my ass ofc bc damn I suck at that game.  But I’m glad people are playing it. Truly. So                                       parxies. Once awsten makes his grand  return maybe I’ll try to get him to play it. I’m pretty happy w how lyriguessr is progressing. I’m  enjoying. It’s been such a fun project to carry out from the very beginning to where it is now. It  started that one week we got school off bc of the freeze - I even have a picture of the original  tayLyrics. It’s so so awesome to see how it has grown. Even though it has proven impossible to  advertise to swifties somehow. They’re too pretentious and think too much of themselves. Like  damn. Fine, I’ll just enjoy the game myself. Eat my ass. I cba to promote tayLyrics any more than I  already have. I’ve emailed so many creators too and haven’t had a response. But tbf I imagine  they get tons of emails so I guess it makes sense they haven’t seen mine yet. Anyways. I looked  forward to gym all day today. It was so silly. Literally from 10am and on I was dreaming of that  lovely back and bi day. Which I did hit and I think it was decent. I was quite tired today tho so  everything was kinda hard somehow. Also. I was walking into Greg and ohhh just my luck, Andrew  is right in front of me. I haven’t seen bro at Greg for like 2-3 weeks or something so I legit ﬁgured  I’d never have to worry abt it again but ig I was wrong, my fucking bad. He had been coming in  from the Jester direction, so he def saw me before I saw him. I went through a diff door than him -  I didn’t know how bad of terms we were on and I rlly didn’t want him to like slam the door in my  face or something. But I was really surprised and it did piss me off. Bc like genuinely I thought  he’d died or was never coming to Greg again or something. He also wasn’t wearing a hat? Which  was astonishing. His hair looked like shit btw. I ultimately saw him again whilst I was on the rows  machine. I’d just gotten on there and was resting since I’d just ﬁnished bicep curls. He walked  right in front of me to go to the uhhh (wtf are they called?? anyways the pulley machines like the  tricep pull downs and all that) pulley machines direction. He def did a double take and looked back  at me. Thank god I didn’t react. Probs bc I’m so slow at recognizing ppl                                      but yeah. That’s when I  decided that yeah I actually hate the guy and I don’t want to text him or get back together. He’s  also not ﬁne like that, idk what I was on. He def glowed down or something bc I didn’t feel a  twinge of attraction to his physical appearance. His hair was pretty shitty looking. But yeah no I’ve  changed my mind on the whole wishing him a happy bday thing. I don’t think I want to do itanymore. And if I do do it, it’s just bc I wanna ruin his day. Fuck w his head if I can. I’ll think abt it but at this point I think it’s best I leave things alone. I mean he sees me at the gym. Saw me today. I hope he notices that I do in fact look a lot better physically. More ﬁt, and I do think I’ve somehow overall gotten more attractive. Not to sound conceited, I promise. But I did glow up over the summer. In part thanks to him! I walk around knowing that sometimes I look hella good. I just want him to be miserable bc he realizes he fumbled. And he won’t be able to recover that. I wish bad things upon him (I’m an asshole, after all!), especially when it comes to his love life. But yeah. All the above to say that probably I won’t be texting him a happy birthday even tho I’ve been saying I would for the last couple days. I’ve changed my mind. I have been obsessed w this other guy at the gym tho. He’s sooo pretty. He’s brunette, big eyes, swoopy hair. He overall reminds me a Noah Sebastian, which I suppose helps his case. We exchanged a couple words today - I asked if he was waiting for the assist pull ups machine and he asked if I wanted to work in. I said no bc I’m horriﬁc at working in. But I should’ve worked in fr. I didn’t consider maybe I should ask for his number, but truly that’s just not for me. I’m not an approacher, bc the thought of me needing to charm the other party and get them to like me actually sends my head to mars. And like the type of guy I like would be the approacher anyways. Like the bold risk taker sort of guy to contrast my timidity. So yeah. I don’t know that I’ll ever approach someone outof the blue like people do. It’s not something that works for me. Personality wise. Anyways. What else have I to talk abt. Ah, Calvin and I haven’t spoken since Sunday. I think we both have ﬁgured we each should look elsewhere. Okay I’m so tired and I don’t wanna accidentally fall asleep before I set my alarms so. Ok nvm I just set them. I am so tired tho. So night."
13,2024-09-25,"Journal time babyyyy. Decent day today but not as good as yesterday bc I was less productive.  And CS326E makes me want to kill myself. Positive tho - I DID make it to the gym even after the  MLDS meeting! I did leg day and it was pretty good! And I have a whole 2 dozen extra cookies  from the meeting as well. Anthony might’ve eaten a dozen already tho. But yeah I’m happy that I  got to hit the gym! Bulgarians were better than usual. RDLs were painful as usual. Calf extensions  oh how I’ve missed ya. I used to do 160 tho? And now I’m only hitting 140. I think I can do 160, I  just wanna do better on 140s. Hip abductors were harder than usual but also I did go up lmao so  that’s expected. I just somehow expected them to be easier than they were. Leg extensions were  normal. I don’t know if I wanna hit back and no tmr or Thursday, but I think Thursday. But I also  wanna do something tmr. Fuck around days are reserved for Fridays tho. So I just dk. I GUESS  it’ll just have to be a rest day                FINE. Maybe someday I’ll grow the balls to do a proper push day  but that’s not tomorrow. And it won’t be for the foreseeable future probably. Which is ﬁne it’s chill. I  would lowkey do a third back and hi day but I don’t think that’s a good idea for my body (it’d probs  derail the last back and no day of the week) and I’d I’m an NPC for some ppl at the gym I’m gonna  look psycho. Oh and I fucking saw Andrew again. I was literally done w my workout and I was  heading upstairs to go meet hannah and I was on the stairs and saw him coming from the  dressing room direction…think he saw me too. Ffs. I manage to hit the gym at the exact same  time as him every day it’s lowkey nuts. Anyways. I’ve actually changed my mind once again and I  think I do wanna wish him a happy birthday. Bc I’m bored man and I just think it’d be kinda funny  regardless of what happens. Maybe it’ll ruin his day. If so then lmao cry me a river. If he has me  blocked or has deleted my number it’s basically like nothing has happened. It’s fun and I think I  wanna do it just to see what happens. Add some fun to my life rn bc Jesus I’m having kinda a  shittt semester. Give me something to occupy my mind that won’t stress me out. Aahhhh. And I  mean. I don’t even feel the desire to get back w him anymore bc evidently I no longer ﬁnd him  attractive. I just wanna fuck w his head a lil. Bc I’m a petty bitch and an asshole yk. But so is he!!  Hahahaha. And anyways I have a new gym crush so it’s all ﬁne and dandy now. The guy that  looks like Noah Sebastian…he is so pretty. I didn’t see him today but I did think of him and miss  him. I almost wanna ask if he’s single, but I’m also lowkey scared he’s a freshman or something. I  want my romantic partner to be older than me I’m p sure. Like ideally less than a year older. Idk  why it is. Maybe it just makes me feel more protected somehow. But yeah. That’s another reason  why I don’t like asking for ppls’ numbers and such. Like what do I do if I approach someone and  they’re like yeah I’m a freshman? It’s be weird asf to be like oh sorry never mind then. But I’d  kinda have to do that right? For freshmen speciﬁcally bc the 2 year age gap to me just feels a tad  excessive. So yeah. I just really don’t have the balls to approach people. And then again, I so  rarely see someone and feel strongly enough abt them to even consider approaching them. Ok so  I’m listening to motionless in white rn and these two songs of theirs I’ve listened to go hard. I  might have to get into them lowkey. Okay I’m way tired so I think I will get to bed very soon. I hope  tmr can be productive. I’m just a tad troubled abt what I will do at night. Bc I’m so used to hitting  the gym on Wednesday evenings but now I’m like what the hell am I gonna do. I just don’t think  there are enough machines at Greg that I’d like to use that would warrant another fuck around  day. Oh Jesus all the words in this page are blurring together so I’m gonna go ahead and stop andgo to bed. Lmao. Tired."
12,2024-09-26,"Hello ladssss. Today was quite eventful so do let me update you. In terms of schoolwork it was  fairly average, but I’m happy with my productivity! I worked on research stuff and was able to  compare tweets from individualist vs collectivist cultures. There’s kinda a difference but also it’s a  fairly small subset of tweets and there may be more preprocessing I ought to do so no  guarantees. But I’m glad I got to that. And btw journaling abt this helped me remember that I have  to run my tweet retriever overnight. So I’ve just set that up. During the day I also ﬁgured out food  card check out for our MLDS ofﬁcer social and ﬁlled out the invoice submission form. And set up  some things for the SDS 336 project. And yeah I think that’s all. I spent over an hour ﬁrst thing in  the morning trying to set up a property on Google analytics to account for my main site plus all the  subapps but it didn’t work. Which was lame. I really wanna ﬁgure it out and it’s mad annoying that  it won’t work. But whatever. Bc I just wanna know the number of all encompassing users I have.  Bc most ppl actually don’t go to the main site and access the apps via a direct link to that app. So  yeah. Would be helpful if I could ﬁgure it out. I went to Hannah’s ochem work session afterwards.  It started at 6 but I got super lost so ended up getting to the room just before 7, but she basically  stayed an extra hour so I just worked on mapping countries as either collectivist, individualist, or  none based on hofstede’s index, which was used by a fairly recent study. So I ﬁgured it was  reliable enough. Oh and update on uhhh andrew. I know I said I realized I was no longer feeling  the desire to “win him back” per se. But I did still wanna wish him a happy birthday so I did. A very  casual message. He replied a couple hours later thanking me, wishing I was well, and saying we  ought to catch up. Which confused me tbh but I went w it and was like yeah I’m great and yeah we  should catch up. He liked the message way later and it just ended there. Which was very  convenient bc I didn’t particularly feel like continuing the convo, I just wanted to wish bro a happy  bday bc yk how I am w those. Very particular. After work session at 8ish hannah and I went to  Greg. I have it set in stone that I was gonna gym tmr, since Thursdays are my hardest days and I  always want to unwind at the gym after. So I just sat around for an hour ish and watched hannah  play and scrolled twitter and such. This guy came up to me and asked if I wanted to play and I  was like nah I suck man and I’m just here to watch my roommate. I thought he was kinda cute  lowkey. But most the hour I was sat up against the wall watching this one guy pepper. Bro was  beautiful. And I was aware he had a girlfriend bc I saw them together once. But I see him in the  gym a lot so I recognize him now. But yeah bro was gorgeous. And at a point I was like yeah no I  gotta get the hell outta here I can’t keep obsessing over every pretty boy. And hannah ended up  staying way longer (she meant to go home w me) so I just left. I got to the stop light (it turned red  as soon as I got there ofc) so I just stopped and rested there. I realized that guy that’d asked me if  I wanted to play volleyball was next to me, and he greeted me ﬁrst. He was like oh hey and we  struck up a convo. Once we got to the other side he told me he thought I was cute! And asked for  my number so we could go out sometime. His name is Kyler! And we exchanged some very basic  info - I told him I’m a junior and I’m 20. He’s also 20 (older than me tho - Nov. 2003 bday, which  happens to be a great age gap for me…) but he doesn’t go here. I ﬁgured I could talk more in  depth abt that w him when we hang out. Lots of ppl at volleyball don’t go here which is interesting.  But once I got back we ended up texting a bunch? And…I like him. The vibes are good. At ﬁrst I  wasn’t too sure - and I really hadn’t expected it, yk? I did ﬁnd him very attractive tho. And he’s  athletic. You know that gets me. He’s black, btw. Don’t think I mentioned that. But yeah he’s cutie.We talked abt his cat, he’s from Dallas, and he’s gonna take me out to dinner on Friday. I’m kinda really excited. But I’m also so scared to be overly excited for things for fear that it’ll hurt more if things don’t go my way. But like yeah I really like him. From the tiny bit ik abt him lmao. He and hannah actually know each other from volleyball. Anyways all in all I think I get good vibes. And I was so worried that I’d never get any luck in dating after the andrew thing kinda fucked me up, but I mean 2 dates in 2 weeks ain’t bad. Even if I really didn’t get along as naturally w Calvin. He’s chill and ig a cool guy to know, but I def don’t see myself dating him. We just lead such different lives. And our personalities don’t rlly mesh I feel like? But from what I can tell, kyler is pretty extroverted so that’ll be good for me. I do like extroverts. But anyways. I’ll see. Again I’m trying not to get overly excited for the future. I’m just saying that I suppose things are looking up. And it’s fun that I’ve met so many potential romantic partners at the gym lmao. I mean it makes sense, bc everyone spends like at least an hour at the gym, which means a ton of people watching, and there aren’t even that many ppl in the ﬁrst place. So it’s easy to just settle on a few NPCs. And I think I tend to be drawn more to NPCs that I ﬁnd attractive ofc. But yeah. I’m quite tired so I’ll sleep soon. Just gonna ﬁnish this song.    I’m not rlly looking forward to tmr. My hardest day. Just really need it to go well and then for gym to go well. Ah shit just realized I won’t be able to hit my fuck around day on Friday bc I’ll be w Kyler ahahaha. It’s ﬁne. Ig I should’ve done it today then but then I wouldn’t have met Kyler, so then ig not. I suppose I can just hit it some other time. Or even during the day on Friday if I’m up to it. I’ll see. But yeah that should be all I’ve got for you today. I’m gonna go sleep. After anything > human ﬁnishes up."
11,2024-09-27,"Okay so. Today was kinda ass and I don’t particularly want to talk abt it. I hate talking abt shitty  days bc that just puts me in a shittier mood. I’m feeling ﬁne now, but during the day I was going  through it. Just some slight elaboration perhaps. I fucking despise my stupid networking class.  The prof assigns stuff at random with zero consistency so ofc I forget to do them…and I hate the  class content and the way it’s taught already, so I don’t even have the motivation to make it up or  ask for an extension or whatever. Legitimately fuck that class. I am def not getting an A in it and I’d  be happy to even make a B at this point. I have the power to improve how I’m doing ofc, but I  choose to protect my sanity personally. We also started our project today. I ended up w this guy  Garrett, which was kinda unfortunate, bc I wouldn’t preferred to work alone so I wouldn’t drag him  down yk. But oh well. The research lab meeting was what rlly fucked w my head today tho. I just  feel like I try so hard but I can’t satisfy the 3 heads. Like I’m sorry. And halfway through the  meeting I was genuinely wondering if I should step down from the course. But idk. I’m still there  for now. I feel so lost and it sucks to not have a peer on my level to consult. But yeah. I also  started my period so everything was kinda ass today. I after the lab meeting I just headed right  back home and laid in bed for the remainder of day until dinner. And at 8.30isjh I headed to the  gym for back and bi. It was chill. Ok I’m actually mad tired so I’m gonna head to bed as soon as  artiﬁciales suicide end. Feel like every time I journal I get so tired. I"
10,2024-09-30,"Hellooo. I’m so dreading this upcoming week. Feel like I have zero motivation to do anything. And  I suck at everything. I literally want to quit my research stuff bc it stresses me out too much. And  idk what I’m doing and nothing I do seems to matter. That stupid ass networking class is lame as  hell. Anyways. I never journaled abt how my thing w kyler went. It was eventful. We are at this  chicken place. Had a somewhat alright convo - it wasn’t very deep and it was loud so it was hard  for me to hear. But like I realized when he pulled up to our meeting spot that god he is hot as balls  bro. And I do like that he also thinks I am hot as balls. Well he did use the word cute and not hot  so ig he ﬁnds me cute as balls. I’d prefer being called beautiful tho personally. Anyways. We then  went over to his place. I pet his cat Reggie, we laid down to watch a movie and he asked if he  could kiss me and I was like yeah (bc hey my guy was fuckin gorgeous I rlly couldn’t help myself)  so yep we made out many times. And I won’t elaborate too much bc ew that’s weird but we did in  fact have sex. And I did in fact suck a dick. It was weird bc obviously it was my ﬁrst time. And bc I  was nervous it lowkey was painful when he put his dick in lmao but once I relaxed it felt ﬁne. We  had to go out and get a condom bc he didn’t have one and I’m not on birth control. Which I  suppose I’m gonna have to get on that. And the dick sucking honestly was a lot tamer than I  thought it’d be. He was kinda freaky tho like he did some stuff that I don’t think I was super into  but I let him do it bc I wanted to experience it. But I gotta say man. He was gorgeous. I don’t say  this super often but damn he was gorgeous. He had his shirt off and bro is pretty ripped. He  carried me while I gave him kisses and shit. We kissed a lot. And it was kinda fun lol we’d be  kissing and we’d pause and stare at each other and rub our noses together and he’d be like  you’re so cute. He did compliment me a good amount. Told me I was cute a bunch of times and  said he loved my body etc. We ﬁnished the movie after and then we both fell asleep lmao up until  like 1.30am. And then I walked back home. But yeah. It was an experience. And I was deﬁnitely  overwhelmed after it. And I know that I don’t wanna be with him long term and I’m not sure I even  wanna go out w him again. Like bro is beautiful and all but I’m not into him like that. And our  lifestyles are far too different. He’s planning to go to the military soon (doing some cybersecurity  stuff which tbf is cool af) so like I automatically assumed from when he told me that that he wasn’t  looking for anything serious. Bc he’s gonna leave anyways. I’m not setting myself up for failure  and I assume he isn’t either. And I think I look for someone who pampers me a bit more - will  shower me w compliments and affection and actually cares about me as a person. And so  yesterday I was honestly feeling it a lot - I feel like it’s so hard to ﬁnd a person who genuinely  cares abt me as a person and wants to spend more time with me without the pure intention of it  leading up to something physical. Not that I’ve had a ton of experience w either side of it. But like.  It all makes me miss Andrew a lot more. Which fucking sucks. But I can’t help but reminisce upon  that ﬁrst week when we were hanging out a ton. The amount of quality time we’d had was so good  for me. And I liked that it was pure quality time, not overly physical. I LOVE kisses and cuddles.  But more than anything I really did cherish the time we got to spend together to just chat, cuddle a  little. And he sent me the sweetest messages too. Genuinely tore at my heartstrings. And he  genuinely cared abt my interests and was happy to explore them. Like come on. I also found him  very attractive - like I’ve said so many times before, he is my type on paper. Athletic, hits the gym  at least as many times per week as I do, blonde, blue eyes, tall, decently smart and hard working,  good music taste. Like yep. I like that. It annoys me so much that it didn’t work out. Because I justthink that this could’ve been such a great relationship. We were very compatible in my eyes. It pisses me off bc why would HE throw that away. Like okay man. Your loss. And truly, based on how successful I’ve been at pulling guys this past couple weeks, it shouldn’t be awfully difﬁcult to ﬁnd someone who will work out.            Which sounds so awfully pretentious and I hate that I’ve said that but statistically it’s looking good for me innit. But since that hasn’t happened yet, I really cannot help myself from missing him. Bc when it was good it was good. We are on good terms now tho. Although I don’t quite think I’m attracted to him anymore. Saw him at the gym the other day and I don’t see it. I don’t see the attractiveness anymore. I think the hair is the problem like legitimately. So I’m not planning on pursuing him obviously. If he asks me tho, I’d maybe consider it but it’s not a given. I’m just saying that I miss when we were a thing. Bc that was a good several weeks. Very very good. My favorite weeks at school honestly. I just hope that I can ﬁnd someone who, like Andrew, did genuinely care for me. That guy way back, Connor - he also only wanted sex and kisses. That was my ﬁrst experience w someone like that. I wasn’t attracted to him at all so naturally I didn’t let that happen. Jazhiel did care about me. And I miss him too but sadly I just was never and won’t be attracted to him physically. He’s such a great guy and I do wish him the very best in everything. Noah idk. He was lowkey just a weirdo and a dick who doesn’t know how to treat women. Andrew yk how I feel. And Kyler absolutely just wanted to fuck. I appreciate that people ﬁnd me attractive enough to want to fuck. I really do. However I just would prefer a genuine connection. I can only hope that I’ll ﬁnd that sometime in the near future. It’s just so hard to ﬁnd genuine people. I feel like everyone now is so fake. I’m not sure what it is. But people just seem like dicks who have no regard for others. It stresses me out bc damn like what it I never ﬁnd anyone. Bc really the only place where I put myself out there is at the gym. Which tbf I do go 3-4 times a week which does wonders I suppose. But yeah. Let’s just hope. We can only hope. And again. I’m not one to approach others and ask for their number simply bc I am more attracted to guys who are willing to take risks. Guys who are conﬁdent and know what they what. And also I don’t ever rlly see someone attractive and think I need to get their number for the aak or a poterkntggllll"
9,2024-10-01,Hey hey. Shit ass day. Don’t wanna talk abt it. Everything is going shit. This is the lowest I’ve been   in forever and god it is miserable. I actually took a double dose of lexapro tonight to see if it’ll help   w my mental state which btw is in shambles. Quite literally the only parts of my at that I look   forward to are 1) gym sesh and 2) listening to music. Like bro. I literally have zero life. Today was   pretty ass and so I was rlly hoping the gym would treat me nicely. Which it generally did - I had a   pretty good workout. But Greg was weird today. Felt so off. I was doing my usual people watching   and I quite literally felt like I didn’t know anyone. Like why can’t I establish NPCs that are there all   the time?!? I did see Alex tho which tbf is just a daily thing. But like everyone else…where are my   NPCs??? It was weird man. Okay for I’m so tired I’m gonna sleep now Jesus.
8,2024-10-02,Journal timeeee love. Today was quite shitty but it ended well and I will take that. Better than   ending shit yk. These days have all been shit and I just feel so shitty every day. The combination   of that stupid networking class and my research struggles have made life so obscenely   unenjoyable. And I’m never one to back down from a challenge - but I also do have limits.   Professor Han is absolutely useless to me. Girl stop fucking creating random ass assignments   during class bc if there’s no structure to the assignments you assign I’m gonna forget them and   I’m not gonna fucking do them. And she teaches class in such a terrible way…was not beginner   friendly at all. I was lost after lecture 1. And bc I hate the class I didn’t bother to catch up in my   own time. But like. She just wafﬂes a shit ton and never communicates anything abt assignments -   she just puts them up and expects us to see them and know that they are there. She explains   things terribly. Why do we have 2 projects AND 2 cm
7,2024-10-03,"Hellooo. Today was actually decent. Like a 5.5/10 sort of day as opposed to a 3/10 as it has been  for the past several days. I was pretty productive. Worked on the stupid networking project,  applied to internships, worked on my research stuff, and even hit the gym. In the morning when I  got to the WCP there was this long ass line curling around the second ﬂoor and I ultimately found  out it was an Apple networking event for CS and ECE ppl. And it beats me how so many ppl found  out abt the events but I couldn’t get in until after 11 bc I hadn’t previously registered. I didn’t even  get to talk to anyone bc the event ended before I could 1) get in the right line and 2) get to the  front of the line. I ended up emailing them but idk if they’ll ever see it. Apple is genuinely the  dream company to work at. Idk how to express it but like genuinely I’d love so much to work there  and live in Austin. Anyways. Today was supposed to be a rest day for the gym but I’d been  wanting to go all day so I mean there’s no reason for me to push back against those urges. I  ended up doing a fuck around day. Which was honestly shitty bc ig I was there at peak hours and  they also just only have one of each machine but I had to wait a ton. And these two bums took the  front pulldown machine in front of me even tho I’d been waiting forever for it. Not together, they did  it sequentially. Maybe I didn’t make it obvious enough - I’d give them the beneﬁt of the doubt. So I  ended up not doing the front pulldowns even tho they were rlly fun last time. I did the chest press,  which was new. The chest ﬂy also required a long ass wait. Really annoying. But whatever. I’m  excited for back and bi tmr. You can tell I’m in the mud when the gym is my favorite part of every  day by like a mile. I wasn’t supposed to go Tuesday - Tuesdays are my actual rest days but I  ended up doing leg day anyways and then a fuck around day today that I wasn’t supposed to do.  In the future I lowkey might stick w Monday Tuesday Thursday tho. Bc I can’t do leg day if I eat  too much before, and MLDS meetings are Tuesdays so I have to stay on campus till late anyways.  Or maybe I’ll keep doing the fuck around days on Wednesdays, but like earlier so I can avoid the  insane waits. Mondays and Thursdays are set for good. Anyways. I’ve recently been so into  wearing my tighter crop tops bc they make me look jacked af. Which btw it’s so cool how I can  actually see the progress I’ve made physically. At least I can see it in my arms. Harder to see in  my legs. Oh and I was gonna mention last night but I dozed off before I could. I am fairly sure I  saw Andrew at the gym yesterday when I was on the leg extension machine. Idk if he saw me. But  somehow he’s stopped wearying hats. And uhh. Respectfully he may want to consider putting em  back on bc whatever is going on w his hair has made him thoroughly unattractive to me and I no  longer feel as upset abt how our whole situation ended up. Like I can say with conﬁdence that he  glowed down over the summer. And I can also say w conﬁdence that I glowed up. So that’s very  comforting. An L for brodolo. Could not be me bc I thi.bnk I might be the hottest I’ve ever been in  my life rn.     Hehe. Oh and also. Kyler texted me asking when we’re gonna have sex again bc he  wants me and idk how to tell him that I don’t rlly want to hang out again. Anyways. I’m so dam.  Tired. Always happen when I journal. Maybe hmmm. Okay bye I’m gonna sleep before I fall  asleep mid entry w my AirPods in and zero alarms set. lol. My eyes hurt jesus. Listening g to the  end of bad decisions. Ok AirPods out abt to head to bed. Last few sentences. Just wanna say it is  hilarious how quickly journaling gets me exhausted to the point where I can’t even type coherent  things. Aight goodnight fr now."
6,2024-10-04,"Hellooooooo. Guess who actually had a good day today!!!!!!!! Finally!!!!!!!!!!! Feel like this is the  ﬁrst good day of the entire semester thus far. It was mainly good bc I had a great networking  session w Apple. Dream company, in case I haven’t mentioned it before. I didn’t realize they were  still gonna be here today, but apparently they had an undergraduate session yday and today was  for graduate students. I asked the ppl at the front if I could get in, bc for some reason my  conﬁrmation email said my session was tmr. They let me in, bless them. I talked to 2 ppl. The ﬁrst  was more in the industrial engineering area but he also did AI/ML. His name was Goutam. We  talked, but not super in depth. Just a quick chat, to warm myself up I suppose. Then I got into the  long ass line to talk to the AI/ML focused guy, n. So technically I was supposed to leave at 10 but I  ended up leaving at 11 bc that line took like an hour. But once I got to the front, Garrick and I  chatted a bit abt why I liked Apple, my past experiences, and my projects. He ended up giving me  a card! So what the cards are - they’re invitations to chat more one on one w the recruiter. Each  recruiter has a limited amount of them, and they have to decide very wisely which candidates to  offer them to. And if you get one, you get to schedule an interview (?) for later in the day w that  same recruiter. AND I GOT ONEEEEEE!!! I didn’t even know what they were at ﬁrst. I was in all  the lines trying to peek at the cards to ﬁgure out what it said on them. It says “Let’s talk.” But  hehehehehe. Funny thing was that I didn’t even expect to go to the event today. First of all I didn’t  know it was even happening. Second of all the event wasn’t for undergrads. Third I had class at  that time. But my instincts were telling me to go so I did. Skipped my whole ethics of AI class. And  it does seem it paid off. I scheduled the interview for 3.30, right after my meeting w Jessy and the  lab. I left that early so I could get to the ECJ and ﬁnd the interview rooms early. The interview  rooms are nice af btw. Never been there but I hope I get to go back someday. Oh my god I keep  falling asleep. Gym was good too today!! Which was so great bc I was actually expecting a not as  good day since I did my fuck around day on Wednesday and I’m still sore from it. But it was good.  I replaced my ﬁrst bicep curls sets w front pull down and it was open sooner. And it was also more  fun. Good to have some variety. Then I did rows. And legitimately forgot to do assist pull ups until  right before I was gonna do the triangle pulls so I went back and did them. Bicep curls were good  today. Triangle pulls were super good too! I went up and did well at it and the drop set was really  good. Anyways oh god I’m tired as hell so I’m gonna sleep now."
5,2024-10-05,"hi hi. lame day today. And honestly I’m really feeling under it rn. I just feel so alone and terrible  and like I’ll never ﬁnd someone in life that can match my energy and love for them. I’ve been  scrolling insta reels all evening and I keep getting couple ones and god they get on my nerves but  I’m not gonna stop watching them if they come up, yk? but it all sucks. also hannah and I were  supposed to leave for Katy tonight but she messaged me saying she was leaving work at 10 and  then ended up getting back at 11.30 bc she was w Anthony. Idk. It just felt rlly inconsiderate of my  time. and she’d said she’d wash the dishes she’d used and didn’t - I washed them bc I didn’t want  them to be there if we were leaving tonight, which we didn’t. idk. it kinda sucked a lot bc I just feel  like we don’t have the bond that we usually have anymore, since she’s always at work and with  Anthony. nothing against Anthony ofc, he’s very nice and I’m glad he makes her happy and vice  versa. it’s just that we never get roommate time anymore. We literally live together. but now  Anthony sleeps over like 3-4 days a week and sometimes I come in and he’s just there and I don’t  expect it. idk. so I’m actually not sure if I look forward to this weekend in katy. like I do but I also  don’t. Bc I just feel out of place now. But yeah. We will leave tmr morning at 9. I’m just tired man. It  is the worst feeling ever to not be anyone’s ﬁrst choice. it’s been how I’ve felt all my life. and it was  going so well w hannah for so long and now I’m just scared we’ve lost our connection and I’ll have  nobody again. I never had friends in high school, much less a romantic partner. All the guys I’ve  spoken to in a romantic context this past year didn’t end up working out. And I can’t help but feel  like I’ll just always be hopelessly alone, unloved and misunderstood. I so, so want to ﬁnd a  romantic partner. Well, I wouldn’t call myself desperate. I just think I’m ready for it. And I want  someone to support me in life, and for them to be my number one and for me to be their number  one. It’s just annoying tho bc god it is so hard to ﬁnd the right people in life. In terms of what I’m  looking for in a relationship, I just want someone who nurtures me and protects me, loves and  sees me for who I am, and who knows how to communicate and be compassionate and  intentional with their actions. Someone who is sweet and caring, not a douche who just wants to  fuck from time to time and doesn’t care for me as a person. I want to be able to have deep  conversations w them - talks abt our feelings, emotions, experiences, values, etc, and abt our  career and life aspirations.          Logistically, I’d hope that they are a fellow student here who is  passionate abt what they’re studying, and that is hopefully my year or older but within a year. I just  think that if they don’t go to school we just             won’t have enough in common, since I’m very  academically driven. In terms of physical looks, I’m pretty sure that my “type” can broadly be  summarized as men that are not Asian. I don’t think I’m super into Latinos either? Basically I am  most likely to be attracted to a white guy. I used to be more into blondes but I think I’m into  brunettes now. I’m also very big on the athletic build - which is just super shallow and I’m sorry but  I really can’t help myself okay? And anyways the likelihood that the next guy I talk to hits the gym  is fairly high, considering most guys I do talk to in a romantic context I met at the gym. But I’m  very much attracted to biceps. I’m a whore. Sorry. But yeah. Ik I’ve outlined a ton of very general  things. But like idk what else to say. Hard to say until I actually meet someone. Oh and very  important - I forgot to mention - I’d want whoever I talk to to be super obsessed w me ofc. Like  shower me w words of afﬁrmations and truly show that I am his ﬁrst choice. And ofc I’d do the  same. As an anxious person I will inevitably need constant reassurance. But yeah. I’ve just been  really annoyed abt how things ended w Andrew lately. Like yeah I was literally completely over itand healed a month ago but I think bc I’ve been so stressed lately, everything is all piling up.                      I most deﬁnitely will not pursue him, and I wouldn’t even want to get back together w him if he asked me, so idk why I’m all caught up on it again. I think it’s the thought of what could’ve been. Bc truly we had it so good for a couple months. And he was completely and totally my type. I just think like what were the chances that I met him, he was attracted to me and I was attracted to him, we liked each others’ personalities, etc? I’m just scared I won’t meet anyone who can make me feel as happy as I was when Andrew and I were a thing. And I’ll deﬁnitely be comparing the experiences. So idk. I just don’t wanna set myself up for failure yk. Idk. I’m so tired man im gin e stop wafﬂing and go the bed soon. Just dropped my phone on face I’d you wanted to know my level of exhaustion rn. So bye."
4,2024-10-06,"hi!! today was gooodd. hannah and I are in Katy!! I love her so much. she is honestly my whole  life. my babygirl. adore her to death and would do anything for her. we got to Katy around 1.30  and had lunch at Asian town, then we spent maybe an hour ish walking around Asian town. I got  Justin a late birthday girl from the kpop store in h mart. and then we went to the cute Japanese  bookstore, where we got 3 posters for $20!!! a massive steal bc the posters were actually  beautiful. we are both super excited for this one poster that diagrams like 100+ types of pasta. We  want to put it up in the kitchen, but we’d have to laminate it ﬁrst. I got a poster of the constellations  for my room. And hannah got a poster w a bunch of plants on it. Then we went next door to somi  somi and we each got a soft serve. Then we headed back home to make wontons and dumplings.  Ok nvm I’m so tired brodolo I’m gonna sleep gn."
3,2024-10-07,"hi! we are back in Austin. This weekend was so nice. It was truly so healing to spend so much  time with hannah again. Just us two. Bc it’s been so long since we’ve done that. And we brought  back a shit ton of stuff lmao. All the Wii games plus the Wii ﬁt board, a bunch of dumplings and  wontons, some sauces, lots of board games, etc etc. I love hannah so much. To death. My  babygirl always. We got to visit Rebecca and the kitties today and ohhh my god it was so  adorable. I’m obsessed w them. They kept ﬁghting each other and it was so cutie. Really makes  me miss Goldie and snowy. But I’ll stop talking abt them before I cry lmao. The drive back to  Austin was nice! I listened to the entirety of the bad omens songs I like and ﬁnished pretty much  exactly when we arrived. It was so perfect. But god I love them so much. I’m so excited for  whatever they have to announce soon. I was kinda dozing off a little in the car and I got to thinking  abt Andrew again. Yeah sorry. Really fake scenarioing it up. I was thinking what I’d do if we really  reconnected and caught up like he’s suggested. Which lowkey probs won’t ever happen but like  what if, right? I’m not planning on initiating it tho. Anyways. But if he does ask if we can maybe try  things again, I know I said before I’d be like nahhh but now I think I’d reconsider. But I’d only  agree to it if I were super certain that we were looking for the same things and that we can get  over the hurdles that made things fail last time. I suppose I’m still not fully over him. It’s just bc I  feel like he really did like me for me. I think back to everything we did together and I just feel like  it’d make zero sense to do everything he did if he weren’t actually interested in me. But then again  guys just make zero sense sometimes. Idk if it’s that I’m not over him yet and that I still have  feelings for him, or if I just miss being liked like that. Yk?? I feel like I’m leaning more towards the  latter as an explanation, mainly bc every time I see him in the gym I’m kinda like ew why’s he look  like that. So I think it’s more the fear that I won’t ﬁnd anyone else who sees me for who I am. But  also I just think that surely something has got to go my way at some point, right?? I can’t be thattttt  unlucky w relationships. But idk. I’m just scared yk? Bc I’m tired of feeling lonely and  misunderstood all the time. Hannah is really the only person that understands me, and she’s so  busy and we don’t always get lots of time together. And like I’ve said, I just want to have someone  who considers me their ﬁrst choice and who I also consider my ﬁrst choice. It scares me how hard  it is to ﬁnd someone like that. I suppose I should put myself out there more. The only place where  I really put myself is the gym. Which tbf generally the guys that are my type tend to be more  common in the gym so it’s really quite a good place. But still. Idk. Idk anymore lmao and I hate  that this is always in my mind. I miss cuddles and kisses. And like ofc Kyler and I cuddled and  kissed but that’s diff. I didn’t have feelings for him in that way, so really it didn’t actually feel as  good. Massive difference. Okay I’m actually quite tired and I don’t wanna fall asleep mid entender  and no bebé nb h"
2,2024-10-08,"hiiiii. today was alrightttt. I did so much networking revision and I’ve actually ﬁgured out a way to  do them so that they’re not hell and I actually ﬁnd it somewhat slightly entertaining, so I call that a  massive win. I still hate the class tho don’t get me wrong. Professor Han you are in my curses.  How you gonna one up Carol man. That shouldn’t even be possible. Jesus Christ. But yeah that’s  basically all I did today lmao. Zero other work for other classes. I need to do all the stupid perusall  stuff for ethics of AI tmr morning. sadly. That class is so lame. Well like it’s cool it’s just that wow I  do not have the time             or care or motivation to read all the assigned readings so I end up skimming  them and barely learn anything. But yeah. All I did today was networking. Hit the gym and did  back and bi, which was chill. Not too sure what I’m gonna try tmr. I might do a fuck around day tmr  lowkey if I wanna do leg day on Wednesday. I’ll ask hannah again tmr tho. But yeah if she’s still  planning on leg day w me on Wednesday I’ll hit fuck around day tmr. Or maybe nothing at all.  Haven’t decided yet. But yeah. Gym today was decent. I went up on some things which was tough  but all doable. Anyways. I’ve been kinda stressed lately (as I’m sure you’re aware) abt never  being able to ﬁnd love. Like it’s truly stressing me out man!! It really does not help that Anthony is  here like every day. I hate kissing sounds if they’re not coming from me. But I’m also not gonna  tell them to just stfu ofc. I’m putting my AirPods in and listening to noah yell in my ear. But yeah.  I’m just scared of not being able to ever ﬁnd someone who likes me for me. I know I say this all  the damn time but like really I do mean it. I hate that I see so many couples around every day and  I never get to experience that. Like what am I doing wrong man I’m trying my best out here. I’m  aware that maybe I can try uhhh interacting w more people but that’s so hard man.                                            Gym is more  than enough for me. I’ve already been talking to a bunch of people at the gym. And tbf the rate at  which I’ve gotten talked to by men with a romantic interest this semester has been quite high. But  damn my success rate is low af lmao. It’s kinda hilarious. Anyways hannah and Anthony are being  gross so AirPods are back in. I fell asleep earlier whilst journaling and I was gonna go to bed but  nah they’re still chatting. It’s times like these when I wish I had my own room. And also it’s times  like these when I wish I had wired headphones so I could listen to music while falling asleep  without needing to worry abt losing my AirPods. Lowkey I wonder if I can get them somewhere.  Ah and I was gonna talk abt Andrew again. Sorry I keep talking abt him but. I suppose I’m not  over him. It’s just upsetting that he’s been over me for months and I’m still caught up on it all.  Which tbf I’d also been over it for months but these past couple weeks have just hit me like bam.  Like I miss that man. Or at least I miss what we had at the very beginning when we were so  infatuated w each other. And I wanna kiss bro. Or maybe not him speciﬁcally but I just wanna kiss  someone pretty and someone that I am interested in. Which I did make out extensively a Kyler  who is one gorgeous man but even then I realized I wasn’t interested in him as a person. And I  was attracted to mainly his looks. Which tbf it’s the same thing on his end. But yk. I won’t get the  butterﬂies if I’m not actually interested in the guy. It all just confuses me bc like wtf is wrong w me.  Do I miss him or do I just miss the feeling of being missed, being checked on, and having  someone to text all day? I feel like it’s more so the latter. But also if he were to ask if we could  rekindle and reconcile, the likelihood of me saying yes is not at all low. In fact it is quite high. You  understand tho right?? Like jesus I am in the mud. I just want someone who cares abt me man  that’s it."
1,2024-10-09,"lads lads lads laxds I ac         t tually had a good day today. feels like this was my ﬁrst actual overall  good day all damn semester. like the whole day was good…like whatttt???!?!2!$/!! it started off on  a good foot bc I got up on time and was out the apartment early, and the crosswalk light changed  to the walk sign as soon as I got there. I got to the WCP and did the networking quizzes due  before class, did the ethics of AI reading, and then did a shit ton of networking revision. Which ofc  the latter was not pleasant but whatever man. Networking was on zoom today so instead of  listening to what prof han was saying (since it’s so damn useless anyways) I just did my revision.  She did a quizlet in class (what, are we fucking 8 years old??) and I guessed the ﬁrst like 4-5  questions all correctly and was in ﬁrst for a bit. Ended up like 7th, which was still really good  considering I know absolutely nothing. Went to ML next, and class was chill. I took my notes and  got a lil distracted playing bad omens guessr and checking my analytics but that’s all really. Then I  headed back for lunch. Lunch was sooo good bc I ﬁnally got my protein pasta and ham again.  That shit was so good. And then I headed to the EER to ﬁnish up my ethics of AI pre class module  and then do more networking revision. Then I went to Tiff’s to pick up the cookies. Wendy asked if  I needed help but I said no bc I lowkey just wanted to walk alone w my music and she kinda drives  me a bit crazy. The meeting was chill! I ate two cookies in preparation for my gym session.  Christine Wendy and I walked to the gym together and then I headed in for my long awaited fuck  around day. I had all my exercises planned out so I was hype lmao. I hit the dumbass shoulder  press ﬁrst. Hate that shit. Saw Andrew on one of the machines and I’m p sure he saw me too but I  think I’m very good at pretending to not notice people. He went to the cables and then to the free  weight room and when he was on his way out the free weight room he went the weird way in  between the benches and the leg machines instead of the row ppl normally go out in (the row I  was in). The fact that he’s avoiding me bothered me bc I thought we were on good terms  brodolo??? Like it’s established that we don’t hate each other right??? I mean tbf I also avoid him  when I’m there for the most part so ig it’s somewhat fair and I can’t quite complain                             but like  STILL I need bro to stop distancing himself. I want to be able to smile and wave at him at greg. It  bothers me if I know that someone is trying to avoid me. Which tbf considering everything I  wonder if Kyler and Calvin are also trying to avoid me. And uhhh Stan too. Bc he kinda asked me  to go see a movie w him today and I haven’t responded yet bc I…am not at all attracted to him.  And anyways I’m out of town this weekend so I can’t go anyways. But I don’t ﬁnd him attractive atall. He’s nice and cool but we don’t have chemistry like that for sure. But back to Andrew…idk what to think. I just want to catch up w him. Bc truly I don’t hate him and I do wish him well. And lowkey he unfortunately did look good today. He looks bigger. I’m lowkey just lying to myself when I say he got uglier bc he’s just attractive in general. I have the insane urge to text him and be like hey please stop avoiding me at the gym bc it makes me uncomfortable but I refuse to do that. And I also lowkey had the urge to tell him I miss him and really hope he’s well and idk what my intentions are but I’d like to catch up sometime. But I also refuse to do that bc I’m not giving him that power yk. I’m kinda a power whore. One reason why I don’t ask for other peoples’ numbers is bc I want the power of control and decision. And obviously in a relationship I’d expect it to be more 50-50 but in the initial attraction phase I want more control. And hence I leave it to the guy to approach me. But yeah. What I’m saying is that I don’t want to be begging at bro’s feet like give me another chance bc ﬁrst of all I am well aware of the fact that really I don’t need him. I want him or at least my vision of him, but I don’t need him. I think I should be putting myself out there enough to have the opportunity to meet more potential partners. And so I just have to be patient. I just miss him. I have zero shame and dignity lowkey so the real reason why I’m not texting him rn is bc I refuse to give him the power of choice lmao. I just think I really need to move on but I CANT and it is driving me crazy. Like…why can’t I move on. Tbf I think I’d move on pretty quick if I found someone else I was genuinely interested in but that hasn’t happened yet. I’m just caught up on it rn bc I’ve been feeling especially lonely and I’m reminiscing upon the times when he made me feel not lonely. That’s all it is. I don’t even think I have feelings for him, it’s more so the times we shared together that I really appreciated. And honestly recently I’ve been pretty caught up on the fact that everyone around me is coupling up and I’m out here bitchless asf. Like okay I have somewhat of a short roster and it sounds disgusting to say but I’m not interested in any of the guys there long term. Kyler is hot tho and if all else fails then ﬁne I’ll hit him up and we can hang. But like I’m just stressed bc how tf do you ﬁnd the right person. How do you get that lucky. Bc I think I’ve used up all my luck in ﬁnding hannah. I’m just scared I’ll genuinely never ﬁnd anyone. Which tbf idk why I’m scared bc I know that I am very independent and I am capable of sustaining myself great on my own. But like I’d like someone by my side to support me. So idk. How do I ﬁnd these men ffs. But yeah it has been bothering me a lot lately. But lucky for me I have been so into the gym grind lately so I’m there like 6.5 hours a week, and the gym also tends to be a repository of men I am more likely to be attracted to. So I mean that’s a good thing. Convenient. But idk. I just wish my life were more interesting. How tf do people get in relationships in high school man bc I’m struggling even in college. Idk. I gotta shut up tho bc I keep talking abt this exact same topic every damn night and I’m sorry. But you gotta understand. But yeah I think genuinely next time I see Andrew at the gym I’ll make it a point to smile and wave bc I hate being avoided man. And I’m sorry if you don’t wanna be friendly but I sure will be. It doesn’t make sense why he’s avoiding me tho bc he literally said we should catch up. How’s that make sense. Like brodolo what. How we gonna catch up if you’re avoiding me. So yeah. Next time I see him, wherever that may be, I’ll try to be more cordial. See if he reﬂects it back. I also am under the assumption he is single rn btw. Just to let that be known. Another reason why I didn’t text him I miss you. If he’s actively seeing someone then that’s awkward as hell AND it would inﬂate his ego hella. Not happening bud. Just a bunch of factors coming together to convince me to leave it all alone. Only action I plan on taking is to smile and wave next time I spot him at the gym so bro isn’t all weird and avoidant when he sees me. Like come on brodolo all I want is for us to be on friendly terms. Okay I’m talking asleep so byeeeee thank tmr"
0,2024-10-10,"Hellooooo lads. Listening to the absolute banger that take me back to Eden is whilst writing this.  God it’s so good. I listened to Rain literally 50+ times today too. Anyways. Today was ﬁne. Not  nearly as good as yday but not bad either so I’d give it a solid 6.5/10 sorta thing. I spent literally  the whole day doing networking revision and that really does take it out of you yk. But I did get  through all the notes I wanted to. Just gotta go through the code examples tmr which is gonna be  tough but whatever fuck it. And I also need to ﬁnish up my cheat sheet. And I gotta do research  stuff. I’m fucked. Royally fucked. But uhhhhh it’s chill it’s whatever. Hey I just had this idea of  doing NLP stuff on my journal entries. Think that’d be so cool lowkey. Wonder if there’s any way I  can do that. Don’t imagine there’s an API I can use? I could transfer my entries manually to  somewhere accessible. What I’m thinking is a lil streamlit app or whatever other web app  framework but essentially it’s gonna be a web app that looks at all the text in my entries, and  generates visualizations and stats. Most frequent words? Most common sentiment? Any  differences in entry lengths by day of the week?? Silly nerdy stuff like that. Wait I really wanna do  this lmao. My word cloud is gonna have Andrew as its most common word ffs                                        but I mean  that’s the stats innit. But I wanna see em. And tbh I wouldn’t mind manually adding my entries to  some other location that my app can access every once in a while and then have the app re run  every day at 5am or whatever to update. But over time that would get annoying. So idk. But yeah  just a lil idea. lol. That’s mad nerdy. BUT I WANNA DO IT. Practice my NLP skills too. I’m so  curious as to how I can pull my journal entries. But that’s a problem for wayyyy later. Well. After  this week at the least. But yep yep. Okay let’s get back to actual life update journaling. Today was  chill. Just a shit ton of revision. Which was painful but really it wasn’t nearly as bad as I expected.  I mean I managed to cover over a month of content in 3 days. At least the concepts. Not the  programming just yet. My expectations for the exam tmr are very low. I’m expecting to do  horriﬁcally so I mean. Won’t hurt me emotionally however bad I do bc I’m already prepared for it. I  am so annoyed that it’s from 6-9pm tho??? Like girl. What. Why not have it during class and WHY  is it fucking THREE HOURS??? I’m hoping to ﬁnish it in around 2 hours so I can run to the gym.  Like I’m gonna speed through that shit. I got priorities man. Back and bi day is so important.  Wonder if I should lowkey hit another fuck around day on Friday. I’m still sore from yesterday’s  fuck around day tho. So idk. We’ll see abt it. Oh and I hit leg day today w hannah!!! It’s been so  long since we’ve hit the gym together. It was a decent leg day. Felt alright. Did my RDLs brilliantly  today. Can go up on those soon probably. But I’m hype for back and bi day. That shit is gonna hit  like crack esp bc it’s gonna be after the fuckass networking exam and a long ass Thursday.  Thursday back and bi is always my favorite bc Thursdays are the worst day of the week for me  and it’s so therapeutic to hit the gym at the end of the day to cap it off on a good foot. Is that the  phrase even? Idk man. Anyways. I just wrote down my journaling NLP idea in my project ideas  repo. Hopefully I can pull it off. I mean I actually deﬁnitely think I can do it. But yep. Although I do  hope it doesn’t somehow impact the way I write. Like I don’t want for the fact to at I’m analyzing  my journal entries to alter the language I use subconsciously. But it’s whatever bc it’s literally not  even a big deal lmao. Oh hm I wonder how I’m gonna manage time frames. Like if I wanna seemy data for the past however many days I don’t want it to have to subset the dataset again and redo computations. Unless it doesn’t take long at all. Idk man we’ll see. Okay. Back to present things. Networking exam tmr and I’m freaked out but also just excited to get that shit done. I fucking HATE that class. Professor mikyung han you and I have hella beef. You are so shit. How’d you one up Carol Ramsey like genuinely how’s that possible brodolo. But what fucking ever. I’ve accepted long ago that there’s no way in hell I’m getting an A in this class. Even a B is a far stretch I feel. Based on how little care I have for this stupid ass class. But yep I’m gonna try to ﬁnish the exam early, possibly head back to drop off my bag and ﬁx up my face before gym. And yes I’m very particular abt looking good in the gym bc I will never do things at my highest potential if I’m insecure abt how I look. I also hate having my backpack at the gym bc it makes the uphill walk back so much more annoying. But yeah we shall see I suppose. And back to regularly scheduled Andrew talk. IM FUCKING SORRY OKAY. can’t help myself. Bc I’m trying to understand my feelings abt it all. I have trouble telling if I miss HIM or just the feeling of being in a “relationship” where we both like each other and hang out a ton and text a bunch every day. Which the latter case should be the case in every relationship. So I just dk. I feel like it is more the latter, but also I’m just so damn inpatient w things. Like I’m all for delayed reinforcement but I would indeed like to kiss someone that I am attracted to physically and emotionally. And that really restricts the set of available options. Again, I did get to kiss Kyler a bunch and honestly if I really wanted to kiss someone I could just text him and I’m fairly sure he’d be down to “hang out” again. I am for sure attracted to him physically bc he is VERY attractive, but I’m defo not attracted to him as a person bc I just think we have too little in common. And like ofc I do like meeting people who are very different from me, but when the difference is too stark there’s just really no way to reconciliate that I feel. But yeah. So I just don’t know what’s goin on in my stupid little brain. What do I want?? I want a long term relationship with someone that I am physically and emotionally attracted to (and for that to be reciprocated to the same extent), with someone who is mature and capable of communication. Do I think Andrew will give me that?? Uhhhh. Pretty sure no. Unless he’s changed, which I doubt. Respectfully. And so really there is NO reason I should even attempt to get back w him if my focus is on a successful long term relationship. I suppose it’s my delusion speaking, but part of me is like maybe he has changed. But if he has, then he’d be the one reaching out to me, which clearly hasn’t occurred. So why am I thinking abt him so much if the reality is that I need to move on and he is NOT THE ONE? God knows man. It doesn’t even make sense. But whatever brodolo. I still think I wanna follow through w what I was saying before abt smiling and waving the next time we make eye contact. Just to spice things up a lil. Would be fun. And I really fucking hate being in weird terms as we are now. Like yeah we both think we should catch up sometime yet he’s avoiding me at the gym??? Come on man. I hate when people avoid me. Like it’s not that deep I’m only human. And I’m tired of feeling like I have to avoid him. I’m not avoiding him bc in my mind we aren’t on bad terms so I just do my thing. But like of he’s avoiding me then I’m like tf do I do. But yeah I’m gonna play a lil game next time I suppose. I am in fact avoiding a few ppl at the gym already and honestly I don’t want to have him on that list too. I avoid this guy Stan. We’re chill and we talk every time we make eye contact? I just don’t particularly enjoy our convos? Totally not his fault or any problem w him but again I just don’t think we have enough to talk abt for the convos to be interesting. It’s always like oh how are classes and I’m like yeah they’re kinda lame I’m super busy and that’s abt it. He did ask if I wanted to hang out and or catch a movie w him this upcoming weekend but I let him know I’d be out of town at six Flags w hannah. And idk if he’s trying to pursue something romantic, but if he is, he really did a bad job ofmaking that known to me bc it is actually not known what his intentions are.                     And if he just wants to be friends it’s chill but he does not interest me as a friend either. Same ish w this guy Harmin. Asked for my number but didn’t say anything abt it and in my mind I perceived this one more as a friends sorta thing but again I also don’t know. I saw him yesterday as I was getting ready to leave and he was literally waiting for something or someone outside the lifting area’s door. So I was like damn I don’t want to talk to him so I went the other door to try and buy time but that didn’t help. So I just put my head down and tried to ﬁx the tiff’s treat box that I’d squashed under my bag. And we didn’t chat luckily. I haven’t seen him but Calvin idk what the vibes are. Ig we both realized we didn’t mesh. But I think we should be on ﬁne terms. Just awkward. So see. Just already too many people I want to avoid and I don’t want Andrew to be another one of those. But yeah. Not quite that sure what I want w him but at the very least I wanna be on good terms again. Okay I’m tired and I’ve got a big day tmr so off I go to bed. Night!!"
4,2024-10-11,"hiii lads. So I had an awfual day today and honestly I don’t wanna talk abt it which rlly defeats the  purpose of journaling innit. But whatever. I’ll see. The good part of today tho was that I did actually  start up my journal NLP idea. And it’s going well!! Lmao. I exported my entries up till and including  yday’s, extracted the text, and made word clouds. Made a streamlit app where I can change the  date range and the word cloud changes with it. It actually is so much fun and I’m so glad I thought  of it. It’s just a very basic app rn tho and I’m gonna update it so I can see the actual frequencies of  each unigram or bigram. maybe ﬁgure out how to analyze emojis. display the frequency table.  Things like that. But the most common word in the recent month or couple months I think was  gym?? Which is so silly. But yeah makes sense bc damn I talk abt the gym a lotttt. Think was  common too. (I’m making it more common now lmao). Actually I believe “good” was the most  common word. Which fairs. I do say it a lot. Like oh today was good. Brodolo was there too which  is so funny. Also lads. And hannah. And Andrew. And kyler. And curse words ofc. But yeah super  fun and I’m excited to keep working on it. My day was so mid overall tho. Actually worse than mid  it was actually bad. Would rate the day like a 3.5/10. I went to the studio for ethics of AI since it’s a  requirement and this was the ﬁrst time they had so few ppl (there were only 6 of us) so then I  actually had to speak. Which was so annoying bc I was so out of it today and all like 200 ppl in the  class online got to witness that. There wasn’t class for networking today so I ﬁnished up my cheat  sheet (which btw did not end up helping like at ALL during the acc exam). I did not pay any  attention during ML bc I was working on my damn journal analyzer                           then I amet w jessy and the  lab. I had literally zero updates bc this week has been so excruciatingly busy. So I sat around for  an hour messing w my journal analyzer and half listening to what the others were discussing.  Then I went to the EER to continue studying but I ended up doing my journal analyzer again -  that’s when I actually built the UI. then I went to the exam and god I ﬂunked that shit SO BAD.  legit think even a 20 out of 200 might be tough. The test was so disgusting. The questions were  awfully formatted and some literally were fucking bullet points?? And the grammar was all messed  up. There were like 5 questions where we had to draw diagrams. I skipped all those bc fuck off. I  was able to do the questions abt delay. Not sure if I did em right but I tried. But yeah it was an  awful exam. It was 16 pages long and we had to write our name and EID on every damn page. I  ended up leaving at 7.30ish (literally after only half the allotted exam time) bc I’d done all I could  and no matter how much time you give me I wouldn’t be able to solve the remaining questions.  And I had more important things - GYM!! I rushed home to ﬁx up my face and drop my bag off and  grab a lil bite to eat. So I go to piss right and I lift the toilet seat and there’s a massive pile of shitright there unﬂushed. I nearly threw up right then and there. I tried to ﬂush it down multiple times but it wouldn’t go. I asked hannah if she knew of it and she didn’t - I ended up leaving it bc I was genuinely gonna barf. I left for greg and back and bi day! But update on the pile of shit before I talk abt my gym session - it isn’t mine or Hannah’s or Anthony’s bc neither of us were here during the day. We had a maintenance guy come in to ﬁx our somewhat clogged shower drain and he’s the only person who couldn’t left the shit. Bc hannah and I have an alibi. He also fucked the drain bc it’s so much worse than it was before. But that genuinely nearly sent me over the edge. Who does that man. It was so gross. Legitimately. And it was so big                   like damn. Thank god hannah ended up clearing it up bc if I tried again I really would’ve thrown up. Ok now abt gym. It was good today!! I was so excited for back and bi day bc it really has become very enjoyable as of late. I’m really happy w how I’ve progressed w bicep curls today. The curls on the machine were good!!! I’ve been struggling w the 30s for so long but today and on Tuesday’s fuck around day they were good! So I might be able to go up very soon. And the bicep curls on the bench were really really good today. I went up all 3 sets to bar + 10, and managed to do like 9 for each set without dying. Usually when I go up in the bench bicep curls I end up not lowering the bar far down enough, but it was actually good today? Especially considering this is like the second time I’m doing this weight ever. Maybe it felt so good bc I did bar + 5 for so long before moving on. And lowkey I think not eating dinner before gym has made a difference. Or it could just be the caffeine I drank. Idk. Too many confounding variables. But generally I think it helps me if I don’t eat much before working out, most especially for leg day. But yeah i was super happy w the state of my bicep curls today. My triangle pulls were good too. I went up recently to 27.5, and I looked back at my old pull day records from early this year and I’d been on a measly 20. Now I’m hitting 27.5s!!!! The lat pulldowns and the toes tho…those have been hard these weeks. I can’t go up. I even tried going up for rows and really couldn’t do it. Like I could do some but they were all shitty. Lat pulldowns are so hard to go up in. I was stuck on 80s like for months before last summer. I’m ﬁnally on 90s now but it’s looking like it’s gonna take forever for me to go up on that. Whatever tho. Okay I’m kinda falling asleep so let me make some last remarks before departing. I’m listening to who are you by omens rn. Ok that’s done I just set my alarms. Let’s see. Okay. So I never mentioned this in earlier entries but Alex had got with this pretty girl earlier this week and it had been going so well and we both thought it was gonna be serious, but they ended things today. After a lengthy uhhhh 3 days?? Bc he was saving himself for marriage and she wasn’t. Which I feel so bad for him bc he’d truly really liked her and he’d been so excited. So I hope my guy is okay. But I suppose he’s feeling what I felt w Andrew now. But yeah I feel terrible for him and I’m trying my best to be there for him if he wants someone to vent to or just to talk to abt it. I didn’t think much abt Andrew today oddly. Well not oddly. I was just really preoccupied with things. I’m not sure what his gym schedule is but it’s looking like it might be Monday and Tuesday. But yeah I still wanna go through that thing where I smile and wave at him when’s ț or u could bg j sis I’m mad during again ok Jesus I’m so tired. Bye I rlly wrote a nonsense last sentence lmao. But yeah I’m gonna go to bed now bc I need this after a long ass Thursday.  Night!"
3,2024-10-12,"journal time lads. today was pretty decent. on the good end of days this semester. which was nice  bc my expectations were low. but yeah I’d rate it a 6.5/10. I worked on my assignments in the  morning and had a call w tech team at 10, then w the NVIDIA person at 12.30. Wendy messaged  at some point saying we got some random package of perch from this company called julius AI so  after I ﬁnished my assignments at 2pm ish I went and picked out a forest green sweatshirt.  Lowkey I will be wearing this. after that I headed home and made mac and cheese for lunch. laid  in bed for a while watching my crime documentaries. and at 6pm I decided to take a nap and get  up at 6.45ish to eat dinner and then head to the gym. the gym has been a godsend every day of  the week for me so I ﬁgured I wanted to go again today and do an extra fuck around day. I  expectedly overslept and woke up at literally 7.30. so I was like OH FUCK. which it’d be ﬁne if  greg didn’t close early on fridays. I hate that they do that btw. but whatever, i guess it makes  sense considering most people are out doing social things and the only people at the gym on  Friday evenings are bitchless. But yeah I had originally planned to leave by 7.45 but ended up  leaving at 8.16. I cooked dumplings and gobbled them down within like 8mins and took off. Got to  greg at 8.28 because man I was speedy quick walking there. But it was a good day at the gym!! I  hit shoulder press ﬁrst, and really I don’t enjoy that machine much and every time I struggle w the  30s it humbles me massively. But they were pretty decent today! Then I did the triceps press,  which I really enjoy so I did two extra sets. I went up on them too - doing 70s! Oh and I also  wanted to mention that there was a very weird lack of girls at the gym today. Like just less people  there overall bc it’s a Friday evenings but the proportion of girls today was so low. And I got to see  lots of new faces as opposed to my usual NPCs, but I did see a couple that I see every day  basically. I assume I’m an NPC of theirs too now. I saw this one guy that was gorgeous. He gives  me freshman energy tho (not in a bad way just instinct) so I didn’t pursue it (not like I would’ve  anyways tbf). I did chest press next. I kinda like it. Not the hugest fan but like it’s ﬁne. I was  planning to skip it but the front pulldowns machine never freed up. I’m on 40s for this and I’m  doing well on them and can do up soon probs. I did bicep curls after that. It’s so crazy bc I’ve done  bicep curls 4 days a week this week                 and that’s a total of 19 sets across the bench and the  machine this week (I counted). Bc I do both the bench and the machine on back and bi days, plus  miscellaneous extra sets on the bench if I feel like it, plus 3 sets every fuck around day. I am  getting better at them tho. The bicep curls plus the triceps pulldowns have really started to make a  difference to my arms, I feel. They are so much more toned than they used to be. And I really  have come to enjoy back and bi days so much. I look forward to it so much every time. I will say  tho that lat pulldowns are quite unenjoyable. But oh well. Only bc 90s are mad hard and I’ve been  at this damn weight forever. But yep, good workout today and it made me happy! I got back and  feasted on snacks and then watched a couple episodes of crime docs showered and here I am  now. Not super eventful of a day but hey we made it through. Oh and also my legs are pretty sore  from leg day. The past several leg days it has def not been as sore - it would be sore for a couple  days but just a tad. Now it’s like actually more on the painful side. Def from RDLs - think that  means I did em well bc I really did nail them this past Wednesday. Okay what else have I got to  talk abt. Ah. So Alex and j have been messaging throughout the day as he gives me updates on  his situation w that girl Julie. He really wanted to talk it over again and have her give theirrelationship another shot, and even wrote her a really raw, genuine letter explaining things and asking for another go at things. She said she wasn’t willing to negotiate tho. Which honestly it’s quite shocking for me too, given how well it had been going the last several days. Like they were both reciprocating each others’ energy and vibes. he didn’t expect this to come to and end, and neither did I. It’s so weird bc she was saying he’d been too forward looking, but she’d reciprocated every last bit of his forwardness up until this point. And Alex hadn’t expected it bc I guess he hadn’t detected changes in her behaviour or texts. He’s wondering if she just somehow lost interest In the snap of a ﬁnger, which I suppose is possible but I feel like the chances of that are sooooo slim after you’ve literally just met someone that you like and vibe hard with. 5 days should still be the honeymoon phase, way early into it at that. I’ve been chatting w him all day just to try and be there for him, bc I really do feel bad for the guy. Like this sucks. A lot. And it’s gotta hurt so much, because I can tell from his texts that he really really liked her and genuinely thought this would be the real deal. And fuck man, I thought so too. I hope he’s doing alright. And man I personally wouldn’t recover from that icl. It reminds me of my whole thing w Andrew. Except this is worse, bc it ended so abruptly and out of nowhere with little proper explanation. At least w Andrew I could see it coming and I initiated the ending convo. But all that to say I don’t blame Julie, and I think whatever her reasons were, they are valid but it’s kinda lame that her sole explanation was that she didn’t think they were right for each other. But I suppose it’s hard to understand sometimes. But yeah. Alex was really desperate for an explanation - like he wanted to know the reason why she’d ended things so suddenly. Which reminds me SO MUCH of myself bc that shit had my head on mars for weeks when Andrew and I ended things. I didn’t understand how he could just lose interest like that. Like sure there was the physical distance but if you truly care for someone that shouldn’t be that massive a burden. And yeah sure maybe he didn’t truly care for me but that doesn’t make sense based on all he did for me when we were together - who’d even go to that extent? And it wasn’t like he only wanted me for my physical looks and my body, bc we never did anything sexual. Yeah we made out but you can make out w anyone. We spent so much time together. Just hanging out. And he did go out of his way to do that. So it never has made total sense to me and if we ever catch up again I do think I’d wanna ask him that. But yeah. Alex has found a good person to chat with abt this bc ﬁrst of all I really do care abt him and second I have my own #relatable experience. But again. I feel bad for him. Like goddamn man he is unlucky w relationships. We laugh at him for picking up a new girl every week but this is one was different. I felt it from the start, and I know he did too. I’m still so astonished that it’s all over now after FIVE days. That’s literally nothing. But yeah. He and I both have gym situationship exes now lmao. It’s a ton more awkward for him tho I will say. At least for now. I’m still planning on trying to smile and wave at Andrew for the next time I see him. OH AND ALSO I wanted to mention that yday and tonight I looked phenomenal at the gym. Like damn I looked good icel. But yeah. Excited for the next week of gym sessions. In such a bum with no life lmao. But I do really enjoy it a ton. Okay exciting update. Hannah and I are going to six ﬂags San Antonio tmr!!! I’m literally so excited bc god I love rollercoasters. And I’m so excited to just spend time w Hannah. Hannah and rollercoasters - a goated combo. So so hype. I’m kinda wary abt missing the OU game but I think we can watch it in line. But wow I’m so hype. I love love love rollercoasters. And I love hannah. Ahhhhhhhhh. Okay also one last thing abt Alex’s whole thing. It highlights again how difﬁcult it is to ﬁnd the right person. Like…how??? Idr if I mentioned it in last night’s entry but Peter Martin from Shanghai literally just proposed to his gf that he’s known for over a year. We are the same age. And bro is getting MARRIED??? at such a young age and also after knowing this girl for notthat long??? Absolutely shocking stuff but obviously I’m very happy for them and wish them all the best. But it’s just like how can you be sure you’ve found the right person when overall time hasn’t been on your side ??? But yeah I just dk what to do regarding my own relationships. I suppose I just have to be patient but that isn’t my specialty. I’d like to say tho that these last couple days I haven’t been missing Andrew as much. Which might be correlated with my mood - when I’m super down I miss him, when I’ve had a good day I don’t think abt him. It’s interesting. And just really conﬁrms that I really just miss our good times and less of him as a person. But if he asked if we could rekindle I would still probs say yes. Given that he knows what he is looking for and it matches up w what I am looking for. But yep. The human brain is fascinating. Okay I’m super tired I’m gonna sleep now. I keep falling asleep mid entry and I can’t let that happen tonight since I gotta be up by like 8.30am. Alright goodnight."
2,2024-10-13,"aight lads. Hannah and I went to six ﬂags today!!! safe to say it was quite eventful. I’m curresntly  in bed and running a 101 degree fever. We got to the park at 12ish and they wouldn’t let us use  our compensation tickets so we had to get new ones, albeit at a discounted price but still costly.  we got on our ﬁrst ride after like an hour of waiting and after I got off I was like holy shit my head  isn’t feeling great. like I had a headache and being on the rollercoaster really put a ton of pressure  on my head so it hurt. and I was a tad queasy but at the time I didn’t think much of it, bc I haven’t  been on a rollercoaster in forever so I suppose it’d make sense that I feel kinda nauseous after.  we then went to this ride called Dr. diabolical’s cliffhanger. we were in line for not too long and  then got into the building, and out of nowhere I got hit with a massive wave of queasiness and  legitimately felt I was gonna barf. And I ﬁgured it might go away if I ignored it for a tad but no it got  worse and I had trouble breathing and couldn’t see anything - there were these big black spots  anywhere. And bc we were abt to get on the ride I ﬁgured it would be a horriﬁc idea to not say  something so i tapped hannah saying I didn’t feel good and she told this worker who called EMS  whilst I sat against the wall feeling stupid. It immediately helped to sit down and get fanned. But  EMS came and we walked to this cart together where they put me on a stretcher and cared us off  to their building. I’d told them that I felt a ton better and kinda just needed to sit but they were  insistent upon brining me to their building so I was like okay. We sat and got some Gatorade  which helped a bunch and after a bit we left. And it didn’t happen again throughout the day thank  god, but I did start to feel progressively worse as the day went on. My legs started to get super  sore - which they were still sore from leg day but this was fever sore. My whole body hurt and I  was so exhausted - and at that point I realized that yeah I def had a fever, bc my gag never  happens unless I have a fever, and a high one at that. When we were in line for other rides I had  to sit down all the time and put my head down to doze off for a bit. And each ride hurt my head a  lot. The pressure put on my head really made it hurt a lot. At the end of the day (we left at 11ish) I  was actually going through it severely. My legs were so sore I could barely walks, dddI was  exhausted, my head was throbbing, all that lovely stuff. On the drive back I was truly dying. I just  slept the whole way back. Hannah stopped at buccees and I LOVE buccees but Cf genuinely just  felt too ill to get out the car. We got back at 12.40ish and I checked my temperature and it was  101.4 degrees and I was like ahhhhz..:damn. I took a scorching hot shower (which didn’t feel that  hot bc I was fucking freezing) and then took two ibuprofen and now I’m in bed under the covers  still feeling quite shitty but absolutely better. I’m super freaked out bc like what if I’m pregnant or  have herpes or something. Kyler and I used a condom but like what if??? I just dk and it has been  freaking me out a to.        Anyways I’m gonna sleep bc damn I need that. Night."
1,2024-10-14,"salutations lads. today was actually the opposite of eventful. I woke up at 2.30 bc I woke up  feeling not great. did nothing all day and ate some pretzels w hummus for lunch. hannah went  shopping w Anthony bc we haven’t been shopping for 2 weeks. we are all restocked! but yeah I  just really felt too ass to go along. and while she was shopping I watched one of my murder  documentaries and ended up going back to sleep. I woke up the ﬁrst time (at 2.30pm) super  sweaty and the same thing happened after this nap. so I thought maybe the fever had gone but it  was still there. but towards the evening it went down a ton. I drank a shit ton of Bai. like downed 2  bottles. hannah and Anthony made dinner - we had the delicious jalapeño chili chicken from HEB.  I made the rice. and while we ate we watched heartstpppper. and goddamn this season is SAD. it  goes into how Charlie has an eating disorder and how he went into treatment for it. which actually  kinda pissed me off so I zoned out towards the end bc it just made me think of how he had that  whole ass support system and I had nothing like it. which is selﬁsh and I know but damn I guess  I’m proud that I got through all that essentially on my own. and it did make me think of how certain  behaviours and ways of thinking and habits are never gonna leave me. like I think I’ve reached the  peak of recovery. since I’ve been hitting the gym so consistently, I’ve really had a great appetite  which makes me feel great bc I can ﬁnally feel my hunger signals again! but it’s absolutely wild  how it took until this year for that to happen. feel like it was kinda this semester, really. but yeah I  was just thinking damn do normal high school kids have a whole ass friend group like that who  supports them even through tough times??? what the fuck???? even now I’d really say that  hannah is my only good good friend. and sure like I suppose I’m kinda in her friend group but I still  always kinda feel like a third wheel and like I’m left out of everything, which really is kinda my own  fault bc I don’t really talk much, but still. oh well. I mean I don’t particularly mind it bc hannah is  more than enough. she is invaluable to me and I would be anything for her. anyways. yeah just  wanted to kinda talk abt how glad I am that I got through that tough era in my life pretty much  alone and how great of a state I am in now. well I guess this semester is absolute ass but really I  can’t do much abt that innit. I’m trying my best out here. just need it to end asap. I’ve looked into  the courses for next sem and it’s looking beautiful icl. everything looks mad fascinating. okay back  to my present circumstances. my fever is back - I’m running it up lads. I’m at a hefty 101.5  degrees rn. so I took two ibuprofen and hopefully it’ll dial down in the morning. bc I have plans tmr.  got the BISH meetup and I intend to hit the gym after still too. but if I still feel like absolute ass  then there might be no way that gym session is happening. bc genuinely yesterday when I was  feeling the illness at its max, I had zero energy. literally no strength no energy. even ﬂexing my  bicep felt like a strain. this is one of the highest fevers I’ve ever had fr. and it’s kinda weird how  often I’ve been getting sick during college. like I have been getting sick every couple months I feel.  usually it’s like a minor cold and a sore throat but this one SUCKS man. like jesus. anyways. I’ve  been thinking abt relationships again and something kinda clicked in my head or something bc I’m  thinking that I really don’t want to get back w Andrew anymore. not that it was gonna happen  anyways. but like I don’t see that desire anymore. was probably all the insta reels that were saying  that he never cared anyways and if he did we would’ve done this and that blah blah blah. and all  the heartstopper made me realize what actual love in a relationship looks like. and while I think  both him and I did care for each other a lot, we never reached that love stage. and it’s started to  bother me again how we ended things and he immediately removed me as a follower and made anew post. which I always assumed was him ﬂaunting a new girl. so really idk what I’ve been on recently wishing we could reignite what we had before bc that’s not happening. I’d rather wait for someone who genuinely cares for me and is looking for generally the same things I am. while I do think I’m ready for a relationship rn I’m not opposed to waiting. rather that than meet lots of disgenuine people innit. I deserve someone who can see my worth and treat me as so. not someone who doesn’t communicate and throws away so many weeks of intimacy and care just like that. I do still wanna be on good terms tho. so I might still smile and wave next time I see bro. bc I hate having to avoid each other. but I don’t intend on trying to rekindle, and I assume he doesn’t either. so we are chilling. I have faith that I will ﬁnd someone who meets my needs and that I can meet the needs for as well. I’ve been chatting w Alex some more too and poor bro is going through it. his situation is farrrr worse than me and Andrew imo. I don’t think I felt the same way abt Andrew than he felt for Julie. like brodolo was down horrendous and it seemed she was reciprocating that until suddenly she just changed her mind. after a hefty ﬁve days. lmao. I do think I dealt w my situation better than he did w Julie. he was so desperate for her to take him back. and sure, I mean, if that was what he wanted then I wasn’t gonna stop him. all I said after me and Andrew broke things off was that I didn’t think we should keep in touch and we wished each other well and that was it. I like that that makes me seem more secure of a person. poor Alex was begging to have her back man. I hope he can get over it quickly, but honestly based on how things are going I’m not sure abt that one. he really really liked her. and I’m also shocked at how it ended bc I truly thought it’d be a long term thing. and I thought she was great too. very mature. but oh well. Alex and I both got gym situationships now. although his may be worse bc they def are not on good terms now. she blocked him                    so yeah that’s tough. it still does hurt to think back to what andrew and I had, bc it really was great. even from the start I thought he’d asked for my number in a very smooth way. and we vibed well via text. and so it still beats me why he decided he didn’t want to pursue things any longer but whatever. I feel like just based on the initial convo I have w the person who is asking for my number, I can tell whether things may extend longer than the ﬁrst date. if we’re talking for the ﬁrst time I think I don’t appreciate being called cute. I appreciate pretty or beautiful, or even if you imply that by being like oh hey I saw you and couldn’t help but come up to talk. I’m not sure why I don’t like being called cute but it is what it is innit. maybe it’s bc I prefer being perceived as a serene person. but yeah. let’s just hope big exciting things can happen to me by the end of this semester bc god this sem has been kicking my ASS. it’s abt to drop my GPA hella. but oh well. anyways. I might dip soon. I’m not super tired but I’m not feeling super great so I think I might wanna head to bed. listening to the absolute banger that is idwt$ rn. bad omens performed at mayhem fest last night and I didn’t get the veeps tickets bc I ﬁgured hannah and I would still be on the road (we were) but it seems I may have missed out on the best omens performance of all time. oh well. I’m not super huge on virtual concerts tho. and also it’ll just make me upset that I wasn’t there. but god I love this band sm. they’re perfect. and I am so excited for that they have upcoming. OH and they literally performed anything > human…I’m not jealous AT ALL!! and also idwt$                      which I’m p sure they played on tour but still. based on all the pics the visuals were insane. and I LOVE when artists take time to really craft their concert visuals. okay so my watch is still charging so I might hang around a lil longer. I hate when it dies before the end of the day bc I need it to count my steps!!! okay so what have I got to talk abt. uhhh. I checked my weekly airbuds summary tonight and I listened to 1.3k minutes of bad omens and 1.2k of sleep token lmao. for a total of over 3k minutes across theweek. I listened to rain by sleep token 131 times…and take me back to Eden 41 times. those two songs are SO GOOD and I can’t believe I didn’t appreciate them sooner. I listened to what it cost and like a villain 40 times too. usually it’s around 20-25 times in a week so I guess I’ve just been on that music grind this week. oh yeah and I also listened to artiﬁcial suicide 43 times. I also cannot believe I didn’t use to like that song bc I thought it was too screamy. same w dethrone. artiﬁcial suicide is now like my 4th top omens song even tho I literally only got into it over the summer instead of February like all the other death of peace of mind songs. my Spotify wrapped is gonna be so aggressively dominated by bad omens lmao. top song like a villain and then what it cost, then idwt$, then artiﬁcial suicide, and 5th lowkey idk yet. but it’ll def be a death of peace of mind song. unless I really run up a sleep token song. they’re def gonna be my second top artist tho. actually idk it might be close btwn sleep token and waterparks. I’ve been out of my waterparks era recently tho. like I don’t even listen to them anymore bc my gym playlist is all metalcore atm. I have waterparks at the end of the playlist but since the playlist is 3h long I never get there. okay enough abt the extremely detailed and useless music talk lmao. let me see what else I’ve got to talk abt. ok well ig I need to make plans for tmr. hopefully I won’t be feeling like absolute shit in the morning. bc the last thing I wanna do is to start my week off on an unproductive foot. I’ll have to pack my ibuprofen. maybe a Bai too bc somehow I swear it makes me feel better than just drinking normal water. I think it has antioxidants in it but idk if that would have an impact on how I feel? ah maybe that’s why I’m so awake rn. aside from sleeping all day. bai does have caffeine in it and if I had 2-2.5 bottles today that’s like a good 270mg of caffeine. oops. hopefully I won’t be exhausted tmr bc I did sleep a ton today. fever wise this is def worse than when I caught the ﬂu whilst in Argentina. but this time around I don’t have a sore throat which is weird but I appreciate it. my body is so hot tho. it’s such a weird feeling bc I’m just laying here and I can feel the heat radiating off me. I’m super excited that it’s starting to cool down this week. on Wednesday the high is literally 77 degrees! granted it may change but still! sweater weather is here lads. I always struggle w what pants to wear underneath sweaters tho. and it pisses me off. bc I just feel like I look like shit wearing jeans. I usually go w leggings but I can’t say I’m a massive fan of the overall look. luckily I think I’m thinking a little too far ahead rn - it’s still generally short sleeve weather. I’m gonna do the crop top + shorts + oversized jacket ﬁt. one of my favorite ﬁts for sure. I washed my jacket to prepare as well hehe. okay I think my watch is well charged enough for me to unplug it now. it’s really annoying how quickly the battery drains. like why do I have to charge it every day. like sure I have to charge my phone every day but that’s bc I’m actively using it plus I can still use it while it’s charging. but whatever. okay take me back to Eden has ended so I’m gonna call it a day here. alright night! let us hope that this upcoming week treats us well. cheers!"
0,2024-10-15,hey so lowkey don’t feel like journaling today so I might just leave it like this lmao please forgive.   in summary I’m tired and I had a long stressful lame ass day and I don’t particularly wanna talk abt   it. I did before but now I don’t wanna anymore. so that’s that. listening to catch your breath rn   while I scroll insta aimlessly. correction. not aimlessly. I’m unfollowing all the petty ass bitches who   don’t follow me back. you ain’t a celebrity!!!
